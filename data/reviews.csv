11239,Shall We Dance?,1996, After finally seeing the remake with JLo and Richard Gere  many people told me about this original version and I finally decided to check it out  The film has its appeal  and you can tell a lot of the tone and charm of the remake was derived from this one  being slightly different as you would anticipate given that the Japanese sillyness and humour is by default different from the American  The characters are entertaining to watch  and the romance is still nice  and the performers do a terrific job delivering  What I believe the remake did well was to cut a lot of time  because while it is true that a lot of that time here is going to character development  I think two hours and fifteen minutes is just too excessive for a movie like this All in all  although I think the remake is more memorable in many ways  if you liked that version  I d say it s worth seeing this version  in any case  you ll get a lot more TODAY SCHEDULEDownhillEasy VirtueThe Responsive EyeShall We ,3.0,"Rafael ""Parker!!""

11239,Shall We Dance?,1996, I found this really enjoyable  good natured and quite heart warming  However  two things   I do feel he was being unfair to his wife  Second point and the major one   I cannot reconcile that Blackpool in the 90s was still the centre of the Ballroom dancing world  I do understand the Tower Ballroom is world famous for this  I ve been there  but Blackpool is not quiet  For the last few years it is budget Vegas on the English coast  and at time of writing  the crime rate is 150  of the national UK average  Sorry to any followers of mine readers of this  stating that about Blackpool if you live there or are fond of it  I was born in Luton so I shouldn t really speak  about anything really As per Bloomberg Walk into a pub in Blackpool  England  and you risk having your shoes vomited upon or being whacked in the face by an inflatable pink phallus  That s because the seaside town is ground zero for the country s  stag and hen  bashes  pre wedding blowouts that swirl booze  buffoonery  and public lewdness into shrieking tornadoes of pure party destruction Full article www bloomberg com news articles 2014 06 30 the grotesque glory of blackpool s stag and hen partiesAnd my fav part from the article And should you ever decide to get hitched there  remember this side note from the photographer himself   For those with a bigger budget  dwarves can be hired out and handcuffed to the groom for a fee Minus that slight factual inaccuracy that kinda ruins the illusion  this is a really pleasant watch ,3.5,ALISTAIR LEACH
11239,Shall We Dance?,1996, A perfect example of how far the charm and heart of a film can take it in the eyes of the viewer  Shall We Dance  is the warmest of hugs  a celebration of life and self love  Living a life that is monotonous and detached and impulsively finding it rejuvenated by a jolt of lightning in the form of ballroom dance  All those simultaneously busy yet lonely train rides back from the office  the feeling that something is lacking from life  the passive acceptance of earning money for the sake of mortgage  This severe lack of fun in life finds its knight in shining armour in the form of dancing  His own reason for choosing to dance is not the sincerest at first  but he discovers a newfound passion in it soon after  Heartwarming  Life affirming  Midlife crisis has never looked this enviable ,4.5,Ayush
11239,Shall We Dance?,1996, Dear Japanese Cinema Every genre you attempt there is a certain freshness to it In this case even though the concept is not associated with your culture yet again you made me smile  Seeing Sugiyama s personal life its something i want to happen to me  its a family I wish to possess   Wonderful performances well choreographed dancing moves its a winner all the way P S   Please avoid the Hollywood remake at all costs ,5.0,Varghese
11239,Shall We Dance?,1996, Shall We Simp Middle aged family dude sees hot chick on his way home each night and discovers she s a dance instructor  so naturally  he decides to take up dance classes in hopes of scoring some poontang Begins as a basic simp story about a man exploring his release from the daily mundane  then gradually steps into the rediscovery of joy  finding something to look forward to each week and remembering how to really smile again I could have done with more of Naoto s weirdo wig wearing office high jinks  as well as Akira s not so subtle detective story  Was even expecting a tad more from the dude s wife and daughter  who completely vanish during the 2nd act  Interesting to see the stigma of dancing for men being a big thing back then  the guys hide it like they re regular visitors to a strip club or something  It s got a good message  great bookend and worth seeing at least once  ballroom dancing aka boring dancing ain t really my thing  The current LB poster once again looks like crap that I would have flicked by had someone not informed me of this Japanese classic  There s one scene where Koji and Naoto are in the bathroom together using the urinal stalls and after chatting  Naoto leaves without flushing  Did he want Koji to continue smelling his pee ,4.0,‚ìà‚ìí‚ìò-‚íª‚ìò ‚ìå‚ìê‚ì¢‚ìê‚ìë‚ìòüç•
11239,Shall We Dance?,1996, Middle age crisis is often shown through a negative lens either through mundane life or regrettable actions  But here is a movie that tries to put a positive spin through dancing  Shohei has worked very hard for success and has everything the society expects  a loving wife and kid  a steady job  a new house but he isn t happy  While gazing at the city from his usual route to home from work  he falls for a beautiful woman and signs up for dancing classes after learning that she runs a dance school  This sounds like a dirty old man looking for a cheap hook up but it s not  What follows is a beautiful story of someone finding the guts to get out of their comfort zone and discover the freedom and healing power that dancing holds All the characters are lovable and well written  also perfectly cast but Koji Yakusho steals the show with every little detail  the shy nature  nervousness  missteps  gradual change of body posture etc,4.5,Bhavya
11239,Shall We Dance?,1996, Probably deserves a lower score I find the genre about middle aged men existentially upset about their good jobs and caring families not being enough for them to be ethically irresponsible  but the casting and editing do a lot here to paper over my disdain  I imagine the American remake is miserable with Richard Gere s smug face But Yakusho s handsome  confused everymanness  Kusakari s sad droopy eyes  Kusamara s incredible gentle and accepting expressions  combine to create something far more tender and less egocentric than what that plot description typically entails  The editing and its dedication to a slow  often removed look at this story give just enough emotional distance from the characters to turn this into a surprisingly pleasant story about not getting what you want and instead getting what you need 7 15 ,3.0,Rembrandt Q Pumpernickel
11239,Shall We Dance?,1996, For a middle aged married man  an escape from the mundanity of his job and life arrives in the form of a peek outside the train window during his daily commute  That woman who gazes out of her dance classroom  allures him  so much so that the most exciting part of his day becomes that 1 second glance at that train station Does he desire her or the freedom or lack thereof in her eyes when he first saw her Koji Yakusho  who I had only seen in serious and heavy roles  is a revelation here  so gentle and humane  I cried a lot in the first act  just for his eyes  The moment when the detectives find him dancing alone under the rain and the moment when she looks out and he s practising the steps while waiting for the train  so piercing The first hour blazes with a poignant yet kinetic energy  If the second hour wasn t so dragged out  and knew where to go after an excellent build up  I would have loved it more Some things irk me   why the fuck are you shouting your dad s name repeatedly and calling attention to the fact that his daughter and wife are in audience  during his performance  when it s obvious that it would break his concentration and make him forfeit dancing  That scene was very hard and irritating to watch  Can t you confront him once he s home Trains in Japanese cinema,,edil

69470,Secret Fantasy,1971, I think the premise is pretty funny and the fact that it s just a man obsessed with his hot wife is actually kind of sweet  Happily married couples aren t normally the subject of a sex comedy so that s a nice change of paste  Unfortunately the film tends to wear itself out after about 60 minutes  The film isn t really erotic so the last 50 minutes is fairly repetitive  I think it s still pretty enjoyable though despite being a pretty mediocre film ,3.0,Oros

69470,Secret Fantasy,1971, I think the premise is pretty funny and the fact that it s just a man obsessed with his hot wife is actually kind of sweet  Happily married couples aren t normally the subject of a sex comedy so that s a nice change of paste  Unfortunately the film tends to wear itself out after about 60 minutes  The film isn t really erotic so the last 50 minutes is fairly repetitive  I think it s still pretty enjoyable though despite being a pretty mediocre film ,3.0,Oros

10747,The Outlaw Josey Wales,1976, Clint Eastwood A Retrospective   Week 19Josey Wales  Clint Eastwood  watches helplessly as his wife and child are murdered  by Union men led by Capt  Terrill  Seeking revenge  Wales joins the Confederate Army  He refuses to surrender when the war ends  but his fellow soldiers go to hand over their weapons   and are massacred by Terrill  Wales guns down some of Terrill s men and flees to Texas  where he tries to make a new life for himself  but the bounty on his head endangers him and his new surrogate family This is easily Eastwood s finest directed effort up to this point in his career  In fact if you take out his Leone movies this must be his best film up to 1976 The story is a classic western tale  hell it s a powerful tale  one with layers that peel off as the film progresses  Josey Wales starts out a peaceful family man but after having that stripped away from him by violence  he too is forced to take up violence in response  He even has to learn how to shoot  So far so formulaic then  But the film is much more than just a western revenge yarn  even if that aspect of the story is damn good as Clint gets mean and moody and pulls his pistols  There a real strong family thread throughout  from losing his own family in the beginning   to a father son relationship and on to the way he acquires a new family on his travels  it s very strong and gives the narrative a real emotional kick  As Josey goes on his way  angry  bitter and prepared to face the consequence of his choices  the character is constantly forming  it occurred to me that Josey Wales the man was being healed by the ragtag assortment of individuals that he collects en route to his character being rebuilt  It starts out as revenge tale but by the end Clint has very little interest in killing  only doing so when forced into it This movie kicked off a fine run of films from Clint that took him from the 1970 s and into the 1980 s and cemented his place as a true iconic movie star This movie is one of the best westerns from the 70s  a true masterpiece  Extremely quotable  loads of action and drama and about this time in his career  he had started to mix a bit of comedy into his films  Just don t let him spit on ya  HahaCLINT EASTWOOD WILL RETURN NEXT WEEK IN  THE ENFORCER,4.0,Michael501 üì∫
10747,The Outlaw Josey Wales,1976, Unforgiven is generally regarded as director Clint Eastwood s Western masterpiece  Rightly scooping a host of awards  it reinvigorated a genre that had saw little in the way of commercial or critic success in the previous couple of decades  For me though Eastwood s finest directorial achievement in the genre was back in 1976  and the troubled shoot that delivered one of the greatest Westerns of all time  The Outlaw Josey Wales  A revisionist Western that sees a family man drawn into a revenge plot after the murder of his wife and children  there s more to this film that just a tale of retribution  Eastwood s Josey Wales joins The Confederacy following Captain Terrill s Redlegs  Pro Union  attack on his farm  He becomes a fearsome guerrilla fighter with the Missouri Bushwhackers and as the war finally ends his unit is offered an amnesty to surrender to the Union  Refusing to do so  he then witnesses the slaughter of his comrades again at the hands of the Redlegs  From then his legend grows as he firstly attacks the camp rescuing one of his fellow men before a price is put on his head as he becomes the target of bounty hunters and Union Militia now on his trail  Encountering numerous companions along the way  he seems to pick up waifs and strays that see him get involved in numerous gunfights as his decency compels him to do the right thing  Saving a grandmother and granddaughter from Comancheros on his travels south towards Texas  he finally has the chance of some peace before his past comes around full circle and the chance to exorcise his demons are laid before him  Eastwood is excellent here  His stony faced  icy cool gunfighter persona is terrific to watch  Backed by the almost comic talents of Chief Dan George and talented character actors John Vernon and Bill McKinney as well as Sondra Locke s inevitable appearance  there is much to admire here  The film is moody  but beautifully paced and shot  with the story taking center stage to the outbursts of violent action sequences  A Western that for me lies second only to Sam Peckinpah s Pat Garrett  amp  Billy The Kid as the best the Seventies has to offer the genre  this film still shines almost forty years after its release ,5.0,Andy Summers ü§†
10747,The Outlaw Josey Wales,1976, Directed and starring Clint Eastwood  The Outlaw Josey Wales is a stylistic revisionist Western which has the distinction of being inscribed as one of the last popular studio westerns for several years when it initially appeared in theatres Eastwood shows a great deal of tenacity with his directorial responsibilities  and he lays the groundwork for the film remarkably well as a revenge Western  It accounts Missouri farmer Josey Wales  whose family is massacred by Union militants during the Civil War and he lands himself with a Confederate guerrilla contingent  After the war  he comes to be an outlaw and is pursued relentlessly by both Union soldiers and bounty hunters The Cinematography by Bruce Surtees is of high quality  and there s a sprinkling of some great staged action sequences which are commonly segregated by some well intentioned comic interludes  many of which revolve around an extraordinary performance from Chief Dan George as elderly Cherokee Lone Watie It s a relatively well structured narrative where a conventional tale of vengeance slowly evolves into coming to be the journey of a man who regains possession of his identity as a patriarchal figure  and the musical score by Jerry Fielding richly merited its Oscar nomination  where it eventually lost out to Jerry Goldsmith s work on The Omen ,4.0,Paul Elliott

163775,Congo Crossing,1956, George Nader is the one good guy in a land of crooks  all hiding out in Congotanga because there s no extradition treaty there  And then Virginia Mayo joins them  on the run after murdering a man  and things start to get hot  I have never seen Mayo look so gorgeous  The gangsters want her for themselves  but she gravitates to the only Hollywood appropriate occupation for a woman in Africa  nurse at a medical station outside of town  Pretty soon everyone is out to murder the pair of them  including Michael Pate who falls for her himself despite being paid to kill her  Peter Lorre is the corrupt cop letting it all happen  But Nader s sweaty  muscled boy scout and Mayo s bitterness and short pants start to divide the rest of the cutthroats between those in it by circumstance  who can change  and those born to it  It was refreshing to see Rex Ingram  a black actor  as the doctor of the field hospital  Lord knows he d played enough uncredited  native  roles in his time  A simple programmer in Technicolor with a strong cast enjoyable to watch  though the story itself is quite routine I have an original Insert Poster of this movie on the wall  though I d never seen the film until now  yes  I just liked the design  plus Peter Lorre  List   Undesirable  women of the tropics,3.0,threepenny

42792,The Carpetbaggers,1964, Edward Dmytryk s campy melodrama about the rise of a 1920s business tycoon modelled on Howard Hughes  A man who  in the first ten minutes  brings about his father s death by calling him an  impotent old man  Even if the dialogue has lost much of its raciness  the non stop exchange of sexually charged banter remains amusing Here s a sample from a scene between a cowboy actor called Nevada Smith  played by a puffy eyed Alan Ladd  and Jean Harlow wannabe Rina Marlowe Rina  How old are you  Nevada Nevada  You want the truth Rina  Not if a lie is more interesting Nevada  Born 1882  that makes me 43 Rina  You look 30 Nevada  How old are you Rina  20 Nevada  You look 30 Rina  We re the same generation Rina slides up to him Nevada  Ma am  do you always talk with your body Rina  It speaks several languages  fluently Nevada  Mine s downright illiterate Rina  By morning  I ll have you speaking like a native Rina will later be seen in Paris  a city where  they have a great downhill slide  greased with fancy men  fancy clothes and absinthe  swinging from chandeliers shouting  Vive la France  Nevada will send her a telegram that reads  come home to Pappy The Carpetbaggers desperately wants to be Sirk  and it never rises to his greatness  but in the hands of an able director it works well enough as soap opera entertainment for the jelly brained  that s me ,2.5,Smidvin

42792,The Carpetbaggers,1964, Harold Robbins  potboiler comes to the screen  trying to be something it isn t  Main character Jonas Cord is supposedly based on Howard Hughes  but George Peppard doesn t totally convince in this role  Perhaps you need more than just good looks to be a trash fiction hero  Alan Ladd  in his final role  plays Nevada Smith  older friend of Cord and washed up movie star   the role was played by Steve McQueen in a later film   and is okay  but again  somehow not quite right  Carroll  Baby Doll  Baker is Cord s predatory step mother  Elizabeth Ashley  Leif Erickson  Robert Cummings  Lew Ayres  Audrey Totter and Martha Hyer also contribute Perhaps the problem with  The Carpetbaggers  is that it is never in danger of progressing beyond a simmer and the film really needs more to do the novel justice  This aside  it is enjoyable as a time filler and has moments enough not to completely disappoint  it also pointed the way for the glossy US soap operas of the 1970s and 1980s ,4.0,loureviews

42792,The Carpetbaggers,1964, Edward Dmytryk s campy melodrama about the rise of a 1920s business tycoon modelled on Howard Hughes  A man who  in the first ten minutes  brings about his father s death by calling him an  impotent old man  Even if the dialogue has lost much of its raciness  the non stop exchange of sexually charged banter remains amusing Here s a sample from a scene between a cowboy actor called Nevada Smith  played by a puffy eyed Alan Ladd  and Jean Harlow wannabe Rina Marlowe Rina  How old are you  Nevada Nevada  You want the truth Rina  Not if a lie is more interesting Nevada  Born 1882  that makes me 43 Rina  You look 30 Nevada  How old are you Rina  20 Nevada  You look 30 Rina  We re the same generation Rina slides up to him Nevada  Ma am  do you always talk with your body Rina  It speaks several languages  fluently Nevada  Mine s downright illiterate Rina  By morning  I ll have you speaking like a native Rina will later be seen in Paris  a city where  they have a great downhill slide  greased with fancy men  fancy clothes and absinthe  swinging from chandeliers shouting  Vive la France  Nevada will send her a telegram that reads  come home to Pappy The Carpetbaggers desperately wants to be Sirk  and it never rises to his greatness  but in the hands of an able director it works well enough as soap opera entertainment for the jelly brained  that s me ,2.5,Smidvin
42792,The Carpetbaggers,1964, My inexplicable fondness for Robert Cummings led me here  After reading Silversaxaphone s review  I had to see his  sleazy agent  It s a wonder Cummings didn t play more of them  He has a smarmy superior smirk and other self satisfied expressions that lend themselves to duplicitous characters  Anyway  he s good in this  The whole cast is  everyone got the memo that they were doing an overheated big budget trash movie about rich people in 1920s Hollywood  and they went for it  Which means that this 2   hour melodrama has enough dramatic confrontations and freudian hang ups to never be boring  And when the on the nose dialogue goes on too long  you can always admire the barely accurate costumes  So much anachronistic fringe and above knee cuts ,3.0,encyclo_Lydia
42792,The Carpetbaggers,1964, The Carpetbaggers is a sumptuous epic that charts the rise and rise of the detestable multi industry magnate Jonas Cord Jr  a thinly veiled fictional stand in for Howard Hughes  It stands on the shoulders of Giant  but with a different story to tell  the bullish excess of its subject enough to have tested the stomach of audiences back in  64  I found it utterly captivating  with a script so consistently sharp it had me hanging on every word  This film seems to lack a modern audience  but it certainly stands the test of time  it would make a fine double feature with Once Upon a Time In Hollywood  Its one fault is that it ends on a sour note comparative to the 2 hours and 25 minutes that preceded it a flaccid attempt to tie a bow and round things off when all I really wanted was for the damn thing to keep going until the engine combusted Imprint Collection  9  Limited Edition blu ray,3.5,DJ_Keyser
42792,The Carpetbaggers,1964, I like men   Maybe I hate them   I m not always sure I m not typically a fan of melodrama  but the occasional melodramatic film works for me and The Carpetbaggers is one of them   I don t remember ever seeing George Peppard in a role like this one   I just wish that the film had held my interest after Carroll Baker s character Rina left the story as much as it did while she was around ,4.0,bulletproofQpid
42792,The Carpetbaggers,1964, Harold Robbins  potboiler comes to the screen  trying to be something it isn t  Main character Jonas Cord is supposedly based on Howard Hughes  but George Peppard doesn t totally convince in this role  Perhaps you need more than just good looks to be a trash fiction hero  Alan Ladd  in his final role  plays Nevada Smith  older friend of Cord and washed up movie star   the role was played by Steve McQueen in a later film   and is okay  but again  somehow not quite right  Carroll  Baby Doll  Baker is Cord s predatory step mother  Elizabeth Ashley  Leif Erickson  Robert Cummings  Lew Ayres  Audrey Totter and Martha Hyer also contribute Perhaps the problem with  The Carpetbaggers  is that it is never in danger of progressing beyond a simmer and the film really needs more to do the novel justice  This aside  it is enjoyable as a time filler and has moments enough not to completely disappoint  it also pointed the way for the glossy US soap operas of the 1970s and 1980s ,4.0,loureviews
42792,The Carpetbaggers,1964, From a very popular page turner novel of its day  concerning the life of a re named Howard Hughes the summer beach read was chopped into a box office targeted production built from lots of sketches and flat characters in overly dramatic situations  Edward Dmytryk is not in top form  and one suspects there is a more interesting untold story in why he signed on to direct this leaky ship in the first place  rather than the sum of all the young turk millionaire adventurer studio boss loverboy psycho family innuendo being dangled in the 150 minutes of slog I witnessed If memory serves  it also spawned Nevada Smith  Henry Hathaway  1966  a middling Western star vehicle for Steve McQueen ,2.5,brotherdeacon

208835,The Slave,1962, Action    Spaghetti alla Sergio  Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciIn recent years  the story of Spartacus has been retold and popularized in a number of mediums  particularly on film and television  but little attention has been paid to what transpired following his death or to the fact that his legacy continued to carry out heroic acts against the Roman Empire  Corbucci s new peplum is an attempt to address this  Interestingly  this was advertised as an unofficial sequel to Kubrick s picture And  as my rating indicates  the film falls short of Stanley s film  Personally Even if the production design  the staging  and the cinematography  which do a great job of capturing both Rome and Cairo  are very much in line with its prior film  in my opinion  Steve Reeves isn t quite up to the level of Douglas   It s not that he gives a horrible performance  on the contrary  he s good for this movie  In many ways  he makes you sympathize with the character The story has a lot of promise  but in my opinion  it never completely realizes the epic sweep a picture like this deserves  and it may get tedious at times All in all  though I didn t find it to be particularly engaging  many consider it Corbucci s finest work in the genre  so it could be that you enjoy it more than I did TODAY SCHEDULEThe SlaveThe Collegno AmnesiacMemoryNot Okay,2.5,"Rafael ""Parker!!""

208835,The Slave,1962, Early Corbucci swords and sandals action  Not nearly as revolutionary in form or content as his later western masterpieces  but the leftist politics are as plain to see as ever  The story sometimes feels like it s trying to have its cake and eat it  too  But the images speak for themselves  Brutal moments of bondage and oppression in the streets are juxtaposed with scenes opulence and decadence inside palace walls  the social injustices of the Roman ruling class laid bare for all to see Steve Reeves stars as a centurion who finds out he s the son of Spartacus and ends up leading his own revolt against the empire in a very Zorro like fashion  It s pulpy Italian cinema  so there s not much in the way of nuance or subtlety  But it doesn t take much effort to see that this is a story of political awakening and maybe even a call for collective action of sorts  It just happens to also be a pretty fun adventure story about a half naked buff dude hacking up bad guys with a sword You can bet Corbucci handles the hacking and the plotting with equal panache  Whether shooting a battle or a party  his widescreen frame is packed with too much detail to appreciate in just one viewing  He also uses enough split diopter shots to make Brian De Palma jealous The film does feature an unfortunate amount of brown and blackface  Just so you know ,3.5,AD917
208835,The Slave,1962, I m a bit surprised I took in one of those 1960s Italian made  sword and sandals  pics  but this showed up on TCM and I said to myself  Why not   I had watched a number of these on TV as a kid so it evoked a bit of nostalgia   This one actually wasn t bad   Bodybuilder Steve Reeves  who made a career out of these so called peplum films  plays Randus  a Roman centurion who learns after a shipwreck that he is actually the son of Spartacus  yes  that Spartacus  and winds up donning his dad s helmet and sword to once again avenge the slaves   The whole Spartacus theme clearly is an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the Kirk Douglas film blockbuster  which was released the previous yearThe production values actually are pretty good here  and the story is reasonably mature for such films   It s all dubbed so it s hard to fully assess the acting   But Reeves shows a lot of skin and is super pumped and half naked through much of the film   It s a lot more action than love story and the fight scenes are nicely done   It began to drag about 2 3 of the way through  and the ending is anti climactic   But I was most wowed by the on location photography in the Egyptian desert  with certain scenes shot from above in a powerful way Not sure why they use the title  The Slave  rather than the more appropriate Son of Spartacus   the Italian title   Yes  he s a slave for a small part of the film  there s a slave girl as a love interest  and of course he leads a slave rebellion  But who knows ,3.0,Stephen M

208835,The Slave,1962, Sergio Corbucci is considered by many to be the second best director of spaghetti westerns  behind Sergio Leone  but here he proves that he can make an excellent sword and sandal film as well  Steve Reeves plays Randus  a Roman centurion stationed in Alexandria who  upon discovering that he is the son of Spartacus  decides to follow in daddy s footsteps by leading a slave rebellion of his own  The film sports beautiful location shots at the feet of the Egyptian Pyramids and the Sphinx  spectacular sets and costumes  and great action sequences featuring hundreds of extras  Every shot is gorgeously composed by cinematographer Enzo Barboni  Though the special effects and fight choreography can t measure up to today s standards  one prominent prop  unfortunately  is blatantly crafted from plastic  for 1963 this was the equivalent of Ridley Scott s Gladiator  Though it isn t quite in the same league with Stanley Kubrick s Spartacus  The Slave has better production values and delivers higher quality entertainment than many of Hollywood s sword and sandal offerings of the time  This may be the best Italian made peplum film I ve ever seen  It s certainly right up there at the top with Marino Girolami s The Fury of Achilles ,5.0,Karl Janssen

208835,The Slave,1962, It was an unseasonably warm Saturday night  Perfect popcorn weather  I wasn t in the mood for dark  heavy  serious  or depressing  Instead  I wanted light entertainment  Decent action  Mindless fun  Something visual that wasn t too abysmal  And so  I decided to take in an old Steve Reeves movie Since I ve had only minimal exposure to peplum  the  Sword  amp  Sandal  subgenre  my expectations were correspondingly low  Color me surprised  then  at how much I enjoyed this flick  There wasn t nearly as much ham  corn  or cheese as I expected  and it wasn t just a lot of muscular posturing  either  There was actually an interesting story here  well told Reeves is Randus  a Roman centurion sent by Caesar to Turkey to keep on eye on his political rival  Crassus  Along the way  Randus is captured by mercenaries  temporarily enslaved  and becomes aware of his heritage as the son of Spartacus  He then makes like Zorro in a leather battle skirt   playing the centurion by day and a Masked  Helmeted  Avenger by night Director Sergio Corbucci  who would later helm some of the better Spaghetti Westerns  uses his cast and camera to excellent effect  Not only are the action scenes well designed and executed  but his set ups help enliven even the more mundane dialogue scenes  It s also worth noting that the location filming in Egypt adds untold production value to the proceedings ,3.5,Kenneth_C
208835,The Slave,1962, Pleasant enough sword and sandal pulp   This is actually more straightforward and dignified than I anticipated  with the fun element of Steve Reeves leading a double life as Roman centurion by day and rebel slave by night   Sergio Corbucci takes full advantage of the Egyptian locations  and there is fine cinematography throughout   These are not vivid characters  just bodies in motion   Speaking of bodies  perhaps the one truly cheesy thing about this is Reeves  outrageous physique  I ve never seen him in anything before  but I must say he makes a good action hero and is surprisingly spry given his bulky size   It s hard to assess his acting since he was dubbed  but he has stronger presence and expression than many a popular 80s action star   For a cheap  unofficial sequel to knockoff of Spartacus  the film doesn t embarrass itself  even when it predictably recreates the  I am Spartacus  scene Watched on TCM,3.0,Felix Gonzalez

208835,The Slave,1962, Surprisingly good peplum  Steve Reeves is not much of an actor  but he has great screen presence  and that s what matters in this type of movie  The movie does not indulge in fantasy beasts or fantasy characters  Hercules  etc  so the story is fairly realistic Sergio Corbucci s direction is quite good  He sometimes gets a beautiful widescreen shot of a character in close up on one side of the frame and a vast room or landscape taking up the majority of the image  There are some good action scenes  in particular a scene where the Romans are trapped and slaughtered in a steep ravine ,3.5,Sbsulliv
208835,The Slave,1962, Action    Spaghetti alla Sergio  Il West violentemente divertente di CorbucciIn recent years  the story of Spartacus has been retold and popularized in a number of mediums  particularly on film and television  but little attention has been paid to what transpired following his death or to the fact that his legacy continued to carry out heroic acts against the Roman Empire  Corbucci s new peplum is an attempt to address this  Interestingly  this was advertised as an unofficial sequel to Kubrick s picture And  as my rating indicates  the film falls short of Stanley s film  Personally Even if the production design  the staging  and the cinematography  which do a great job of capturing both Rome and Cairo  are very much in line with its prior film  in my opinion  Steve Reeves isn t quite up to the level of Douglas   It s not that he gives a horrible performance  on the contrary  he s good for this movie  In many ways  he makes you sympathize with the character The story has a lot of promise  but in my opinion  it never completely realizes the epic sweep a picture like this deserves  and it may get tedious at times All in all  though I didn t find it to be particularly engaging  many consider it Corbucci s finest work in the genre  so it could be that you enjoy it more than I did TODAY SCHEDULEThe SlaveThe Collegno AmnesiacMemoryNot Okay,2.5,"Rafael ""Parker!!""

208835,The Slave,1962, Sergio Corbucci s spaghetti sword  amp  sandals is the unofficial sequel to Spartacus titled The Slave aka The Son of Spartacus  All things considered  this is a pretty fun  sequel  to a classic  Tonally  it s like transitioning from Rocky I to Rocky IV  Literally a superhero like character  Plenty of action  Decent production budget  Half the runtime  Starring Hercules himself  the very buff and oiled Steve Reeves ,3.0,Schizopolis23 ü¶ÖüèãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
208835,The Slave,1962, Early Corbucci swords and sandals action  Not nearly as revolutionary in form or content as his later western masterpieces  but the leftist politics are as plain to see as ever  The story sometimes feels like it s trying to have its cake and eat it  too  But the images speak for themselves  Brutal moments of bondage and oppression in the streets are juxtaposed with scenes opulence and decadence inside palace walls  the social injustices of the Roman ruling class laid bare for all to see Steve Reeves stars as a centurion who finds out he s the son of Spartacus and ends up leading his own revolt against the empire in a very Zorro like fashion  It s pulpy Italian cinema  so there s not much in the way of nuance or subtlety  But it doesn t take much effort to see that this is a story of political awakening and maybe even a call for collective action of sorts  It just happens to also be a pretty fun adventure story about a half naked buff dude hacking up bad guys with a sword You can bet Corbucci handles the hacking and the plotting with equal panache  Whether shooting a battle or a party  his widescreen frame is packed with too much detail to appreciate in just one viewing  He also uses enough split diopter shots to make Brian De Palma jealous The film does feature an unfortunate amount of brown and blackface  Just so you know ,3.5,AD917
208835,The Slave,1962, I m a bit surprised I took in one of those 1960s Italian made  sword and sandals  pics  but this showed up on TCM and I said to myself  Why not   I had watched a number of these on TV as a kid so it evoked a bit of nostalgia   This one actually wasn t bad   Bodybuilder Steve Reeves  who made a career out of these so called peplum films  plays Randus  a Roman centurion who learns after a shipwreck that he is actually the son of Spartacus  yes  that Spartacus  and winds up donning his dad s helmet and sword to once again avenge the slaves   The whole Spartacus theme clearly is an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the Kirk Douglas film blockbuster  which was released the previous yearThe production values actually are pretty good here  and the story is reasonably mature for such films   It s all dubbed so it s hard to fully assess the acting   But Reeves shows a lot of skin and is super pumped and half naked through much of the film   It s a lot more action than love story and the fight scenes are nicely done   It began to drag about 2 3 of the way through  and the ending is anti climactic   But I was most wowed by the on location photography in the Egyptian desert  with certain scenes shot from above in a powerful way Not sure why they use the title  The Slave  rather than the more appropriate Son of Spartacus   the Italian title   Yes  he s a slave for a small part of the film  there s a slave girl as a love interest  and of course he leads a slave rebellion  But who knows ,3.0,Stephen M

23045,Killers from Space,1954, In 1954  Billy Wilder released Sabrina  an acclaimed slice of romance that stood as the last film for his Paramount contract and remains a beloved  multi Oscar nominated work  In the same year  W  Lee Wilder  his brother made two independent science fiction bombs  barely remembered except for a few key elements and mostly regarded as a waste of time for the parties involved  The difference of talent in these two brothers  lineage is fascinating  to say the least  and while Billy s film has been preserved and deemed important  Lee s Killers from Space has become relegated to bargain bins countrywide and Amazon Prime Video  mainly due to its public domain status allowing any schmoe to sell it to schmucks and because no one would care if it weren t one of the many films Mystery Science Theater 3000 gave attention to  All of this is because it is utter dreck  as I m sure I ve made clear As an low budget thriller  lots of fluff and filler are gonna taint a lot of the excitement and turn it into a big bowl of nothing  Stock footage abounds  prominent  but not only  in a perfunctorily narrated intro that serve no purpose other to vaguely set up the Cold War era panic  Our protagonist  Peter Graves  his character has a name but I simply don t care enough to include it  has recovered from a mysterious crash with only a precise incision as a remnant of the event  Plenty of meaningless banter and sleuthing ensues  all in a very boring  dull fashion  and its emphasis on the small scale nuclear era testing scene defies any of the promise that the alien centric promotional materials offer  to the point where I was nearly convinced Prime had the wrong film until the title popped up  Oh they re there  for sure  but so much wasted time is done trying to lead up to it and by the time these aliens do show up  I ve completely lost interest and have to fight with myself to make it through the end By the halfway mark  the bug eyed  black coaked aliens do show up  ready to explain their plan to the nuclear scientist they ve abducted as if there s absolutely no way he can muck their plans up nope siree  The plan they have to eradicate humanity for the sake of their own species is preposterous  but then again I expect nothing less from a species that decide to teach the scientist they re concerned about everything they know  Even with this segment  the highlight of the film for many  it s still a dull  trite series of events and is made worse through Graves running through the underground tunnels and encountering cheap effects of common animals like tarantulas and grasshoppers unconvincingly enlarged to suggest a threat  This seems enticing  but the fact that it takes what feels like 10 minutes to showcase it in a way that suggests it s more filler to bump the runtime above an hour is what absolutely kills the sensation for me There are plenty of ways to make your low budget affair at least somewhat artistically inspired  and Killers from Space completely spits on that notion for the sake of a quickie that offers very little redeeming factors and boils in its celluloid soup of mush  It may have predicated many of the alien abduction stories that would become plentiful in the decades to follow  but it surely couldn t have been influential as there s nothing to make the concepts it shares any way engaging and memorable to lift wholesale  It s a film that has become relegated to the late night diversions on TV  a fun and valuable expansion on the many ways schlock can and can t work  but it remains at best just that  a diversion  never truly something that should be sought out unless you really want to know what the teens in It Follows were watching on their rinky dink TV  In summation  it s pure pointlessness ,1.0,louferrigno

23045,Killers from Space,1954, Googly eyes from space Another one of those classic sci fi movies that offer a slightly different narrative on killer aliens  but as whole doesn t really give anything else too unique  It s a quick watch clocking only an hour with some change  and even though the mysterious parts start off early  the next revelation happens at too long of a gap  The character dynamics are sort of interesting  but it sticks to the usual aliens are bad guys and want to take over the world with a little twist on a human getting mixed up in their plans  The method on the other hand plays on the Nuclear craze that was probably happening during that era  Shoutouts to Peter Graves  this man really did start from humble beginnings lol Cinematically lazy  I mean the aliens don t even have actual costumes  it just looked like one piece suits  slap on some big googly eyes and you got yourself some lame looking killers from space lol  The  monsters  are just lizards and tarantulas zoomed in to make them look big  man  Tarantulas and Komodo dragons are probably the most overused monster in these classic sci fi movies  Overall a pretty boring watch  it doesn t stand out from the rest of the sci fi flicks during that era  and even though the acting wasn t bad  the plot is just way too generic and predictable  Did I mention the lazy production ,1.5,Jarrel Montes

23045,Killers from Space,1954, In 1954  Billy Wilder released Sabrina  an acclaimed slice of romance that stood as the last film for his Paramount contract and remains a beloved  multi Oscar nominated work  In the same year  W  Lee Wilder  his brother made two independent science fiction bombs  barely remembered except for a few key elements and mostly regarded as a waste of time for the parties involved  The difference of talent in these two brothers  lineage is fascinating  to say the least  and while Billy s film has been preserved and deemed important  Lee s Killers from Space has become relegated to bargain bins countrywide and Amazon Prime Video  mainly due to its public domain status allowing any schmoe to sell it to schmucks and because no one would care if it weren t one of the many films Mystery Science Theater 3000 gave attention to  All of this is because it is utter dreck  as I m sure I ve made clear As an low budget thriller  lots of fluff and filler are gonna taint a lot of the excitement and turn it into a big bowl of nothing  Stock footage abounds  prominent  but not only  in a perfunctorily narrated intro that serve no purpose other to vaguely set up the Cold War era panic  Our protagonist  Peter Graves  his character has a name but I simply don t care enough to include it  has recovered from a mysterious crash with only a precise incision as a remnant of the event  Plenty of meaningless banter and sleuthing ensues  all in a very boring  dull fashion  and its emphasis on the small scale nuclear era testing scene defies any of the promise that the alien centric promotional materials offer  to the point where I was nearly convinced Prime had the wrong film until the title popped up  Oh they re there  for sure  but so much wasted time is done trying to lead up to it and by the time these aliens do show up  I ve completely lost interest and have to fight with myself to make it through the end By the halfway mark  the bug eyed  black coaked aliens do show up  ready to explain their plan to the nuclear scientist they ve abducted as if there s absolutely no way he can muck their plans up nope siree  The plan they have to eradicate humanity for the sake of their own species is preposterous  but then again I expect nothing less from a species that decide to teach the scientist they re concerned about everything they know  Even with this segment  the highlight of the film for many  it s still a dull  trite series of events and is made worse through Graves running through the underground tunnels and encountering cheap effects of common animals like tarantulas and grasshoppers unconvincingly enlarged to suggest a threat  This seems enticing  but the fact that it takes what feels like 10 minutes to showcase it in a way that suggests it s more filler to bump the runtime above an hour is what absolutely kills the sensation for me There are plenty of ways to make your low budget affair at least somewhat artistically inspired  and Killers from Space completely spits on that notion for the sake of a quickie that offers very little redeeming factors and boils in its celluloid soup of mush  It may have predicated many of the alien abduction stories that would become plentiful in the decades to follow  but it surely couldn t have been influential as there s nothing to make the concepts it shares any way engaging and memorable to lift wholesale  It s a film that has become relegated to the late night diversions on TV  a fun and valuable expansion on the many ways schlock can and can t work  but it remains at best just that  a diversion  never truly something that should be sought out unless you really want to know what the teens in It Follows were watching on their rinky dink TV  In summation  it s pure pointlessness ,1.0,louferrigno
23045,Killers from Space,1954, I m a sucker for 50 s sci if flicks  This movie has all the trappings of classic B science fiction movies  There are the cheesy aliens with bulging eyeballs  super sized critters  awful spacecraft special effects  and lots of stock footage of aircraft that do not match the scenes or each other  In other words  this is great stuff  Peter Graves started out in old black  amp  white Sci fi movies  amp  was very good at making you believe in the plot  amp  his part in it  The  special effects  are  of course  outdated  amp  not up to todays standards but it s still just a short fun movie that lets you get into the  alien invader  mentality that was very prevelant in the old sci fi movies ,3.0,Saint_Hooligan
23045,Killers from Space,1954, Uptight army scientist Peter Graves survives a plane crash and comes staggering back to base  eventually spouting an explanation of cave dwelling  bug eyed aliens with a knack for open heart surgery and a scheme for conquering Earth with giant versions of whatever insects and lizards they can get rear projected stock footage of  Another stalwart example of paranoid  50s B horror from Billy Wilder s weird brother  whose lunacy is fairly subdued here  save for Peter Graves s horrified scramble through the alien  zoo  But hey  it s a blanker than usual Peter Graves squared off against chunky aliens with ping pong ball eyes  Sometimes that s all a fella needs to know ,2.5,Ira Brooker
23045,Killers from Space,1954, Googly eyes from space Another one of those classic sci fi movies that offer a slightly different narrative on killer aliens  but as whole doesn t really give anything else too unique  It s a quick watch clocking only an hour with some change  and even though the mysterious parts start off early  the next revelation happens at too long of a gap  The character dynamics are sort of interesting  but it sticks to the usual aliens are bad guys and want to take over the world with a little twist on a human getting mixed up in their plans  The method on the other hand plays on the Nuclear craze that was probably happening during that era  Shoutouts to Peter Graves  this man really did start from humble beginnings lol Cinematically lazy  I mean the aliens don t even have actual costumes  it just looked like one piece suits  slap on some big googly eyes and you got yourself some lame looking killers from space lol  The  monsters  are just lizards and tarantulas zoomed in to make them look big  man  Tarantulas and Komodo dragons are probably the most overused monster in these classic sci fi movies  Overall a pretty boring watch  it doesn t stand out from the rest of the sci fi flicks during that era  and even though the acting wasn t bad  the plot is just way too generic and predictable  Did I mention the lazy production ,1.5,Jarrel Montes

outage in Columbus  Ohio during the dead of winter and my apartment lost its power  The temperatures got as low as  10 and we were without electricity for a week  I was fine  and so was my wife and daughter  Not fine  My fish  See I have tropical fish and they need a temperature of 78 degrees or more to be comfortable but without power  or a generator  the temperature was falling fast  After a few days the temperature dropped to 50 degrees in the tank  and eventually down to 42 degrees and despite my daughter s prayers  the fish looked dead  As we were about to dredge them out my daughter swore she saw a hint of life  To prove to my daughter that she was just a dumb kid  we heated up some water in a bucket and I tossed the fish in  THEY SURVIVED  they started wriggling around and I brought them to an aquarium store that took care of them for a few days before we got our place back to normal  I learned an important lesson that day about faith  Because of my daughter s fish prayers I got to spend many more months with our fish Matsuflex and Admiral Ackbar  God is good  3 people died in that storm  God s got a plan I guess  True story  REVIEW  In Breakthrough  a white Christian family that lives in what seems a whites only suburb on the outskirts of St  Louis  has an adopted son from Guatemala  got him on a mission trip  who in the movie is kind of an asshole  When the kid and his douchebag friends fall into the icy water because they are being assholes  the adopted child John stays under the water for 15 minutes before being rushed to a hospital  Thought to be dead  his mom forces people to prey  whoops I mean pray Then God  who you may know from his greatest hits like the crusades  killing first born sons  Donald Trump  saving my fish  George Bush  global climate change  tons of stuff in countries that we don t pay attention to  and the internet  enters the scene  God likes something about this kid and mom and decides to save this boy in what was the highest year for homicide and infant death in St  Louis in the previous decade  The boy wakes up and within a day people are applauding for him and he is delivered a high school girl to be his new bride  Sure thank the medical professionals  first responders  the wealth that gave their family a nice hospital and area to live  but make sure to thank the pastor who sat there and the parishioners who cut and pasted prayers to Facebook for the big finale  Much like Christian rock  Christian cinema has problems because it s not really a competitive mainstream market  not saying I care but it is just a market reality  The film itself isn t very good  Acting is the one aspect of this movie that is above average  Chrissy Metz does a good job  as do Topher Grace  who didn t promote this movie on a podcast he was just on  Christian cinema is like his mistress he s ashamed of  Mike Colton  etc they re fine  The rest is pretty bad though  The script is super basic and it is shot like a TV movie with one special effects exception that was still just executed in an average way  In the end  you re just supposed to be in awe of this true story that does nothing to indicate truth  Why am I any more convinced that Facebook prayer did more to save him than just having loved ones nearby and hearing stuff about basketball  The script creates a whole fake subplot about one of the men who rescued John  They cast him black instead of white  make him a non believer  not true  and have him say God spoke to him in the water to help find John  also made up  what the fuck is that  They make up the woman not getting along with the pastor to prolong this  It s not like I wanted this kid to die or something but you re trying to say prayer did this and you re saying things like  my son s a fighter  and it s hard to not think about the thousands of people who died that day  many of them probably fighters in their lives  many of them with people praying for them  I can t imagine watching this film if I had just lost someone and having a film condescendingly imply that we just may not have fought enough  It s the euphoric fallacy  The end of this movie frustrates me  They add bullies to the script that badger John for surviving when others don t  which is the essence of Christian martyrdom  But a teacher asks him about why he thinks he was chosen to live  when her husband that died two years ago wasn t  I ve seen people give credit for presenting this question which I don t get because the film never really attempts to answer  it just ends with the  god s plan  answer  thanks for nothing Steph Curry  producer ,1.0,{Todd}

highest year for homicide and infant death in St  Louis in the previous decade  The boy wakes up and within a day people are applauding for him and he is delivered a high school girl to be his new bride  Sure thank the medical professionals  first responders  the wealth that gave their family a nice hospital and area to live  but make sure to thank the pastor who sat there and the parishioners who cut and pasted prayers to Facebook for the big finale  Much like Christian rock  Christian cinema has problems because it s not really a competitive mainstream market  not saying I care but it is just a market reality  The film itself isn t very good  Acting is the one aspect of this movie that is above average  Chrissy Metz does a good job  as do Topher Grace  who didn t promote this movie on a podcast he was just on  Christian cinema is like his mistress he s ashamed of  Mike Colton  etc they re fine  The rest is pretty bad though  The script is super basic and it is shot like a TV movie with one special effects exception that was still just executed in an average way  In the end  you re just supposed to be in awe of this true story that does nothing to indicate truth  Why am I any more convinced that Facebook prayer did more to save him than just having loved ones nearby and hearing stuff about basketball  The script creates a whole fake subplot about one of the men who rescued John  They cast him black instead of white  make him a non believer  not true  and have him say God spoke to him in the water to help find John  also made up  what the fuck is that  They make up the woman not getting along with the pastor to prolong this  It s not like I wanted this kid to die or something but you re trying to say prayer did this and you re saying things like  my son s a fighter  and it s hard to not think about the thousands of people who died that day  many of them probably fighters in their lives  many of them with people praying for them  I can t imagine watching this film if I had just lost someone and having a film condescendingly imply that we just may not have fought enough  It s the euphoric fallacy  The end of this movie frustrates me  They add bullies to the script that badger John for surviving when others don t  which is the essence of Christian martyrdom  But a teacher asks him about why he thinks he was chosen to live  when her husband that died two years ago wasn t  I ve seen people give credit for presenting this question which I don t get because the film never really attempts to answer  it just ends with the  god s plan  answer  thanks for nothing Steph Curry  producer ,1.0,{Todd}

441273,Strange Tales,1949, 1st Jean FaurezA brief bit of counting reveals that for me  this is my 27th Poe adaptation  of which about 17 I ve seen since having Lb  As they go  this falls about the middle of the pack  There s really interesting stuff in here  but there s a lot of dross  largely when the film isn t actually adapting Poe  The opening wraparound and the first story are dreary slogs  especially when the subtitles can t quite make up their mind which sister is which in the first in the Quincey themed story  Whatever the case  the one who s not narrating the story is a shrieking mess of a character  wildly exaggerated in every movement and thoroughly irritating for the fact Happily  this takes but twenty minutes of the audience s time  and then it gets to the Poe  choosing a couple of evergreen hits in The Tell Tale Heart and The Cask of Amontillado  Both contain famous French actors  the narrator of Tell Tale Heart is suspiciously similar to Jean Louis Barrault  and the Amontillado includes a lovely Jules Barry role  and tell the stories with a certain casual intimacy that befits the film  tone perfectly  They re also incredibly faithful to the tales themselves  which as a fan of the original prose I found especially pleasant  Though Hurst s 1934 Tell Tale Heart is the best  this is my fave Amontillado so far The final story includes what must be either the best Frenchman speaking French in an  English accent I ve ever seen  or the worst English actor speaking French I ve ever seen  Due to the poor information that exists on the film  I am unable to provide any clearer delineation on this  but I welcome my French speaking friends and film buffs to clear up my confusion  The story itself is a traditional crime tale  which makes sense considering the lack of supernatural elements in the Poe stories  and manages to include a great jump scare near the end that resembles a certain scene in Macbeth  Pity about the awful singing ending Not a brilliant film  certainly  but an enjoyable piece of ephemera  It s nice to see this on Netflix  no matter how strange that fact might be  and in a nice restoration at that  Worth checking out if you re a fan of the author or Franco Belgian Fantastique ,3.0,Dr. Ethan Lyon

441273,Strange Tales,1949, Short stories from Edgar Allan Poe  amp  Thomas De Quincey loosely combined by a discussion at a police station  And it s fine  Not that any of the stories is the quintessential adaptation of the classic tales  So one could have wished for more narrative care to make them stand out  but this wasn t exactly the greatest period for horror ,2.5,PUNQ
441273,Strange Tales,1949, aka     there isn t much reason to seek out this low key anthology but it s nice to have it as an extra feature on the         Blu Ray  For one  it isn t so much a horror film  despite containing two Poe adaptations  but more of a murder crimes anthology  The other adapted stories were unfamiliar to me and I believe they were tales that would have been familiar to French audiences  There are some slight pleasures to be had here  The first story has some chills as a serial killer traps two schoolgirls inside their room  And the adaptation of  The Tell Tale Heart  is faithful and well done  The second Poe story   The Cask of Amontillado  is less successful and shows why it is relatively little adapted for film  There just isn t much story there even for a short  The power of that story lies in Poe s descriptive language and not in the barely there plot  And the final segment  about a well liked man who is murdered  is completely predictable and aside from one great visual at its denouement  disposable  The wraparound story is merely the gendarmerie sitting around swapping these stories of cases they have worked on  Honestly  that s all I can say for the film  I m sure I will have mostly forgotten it by next week ,3.0,Michael Shawn

441273,Strange Tales,1949, 1st Jean FaurezA brief bit of counting reveals that for me  this is my 27th Poe adaptation  of which about 17 I ve seen since having Lb  As they go  this falls about the middle of the pack  There s really interesting stuff in here  but there s a lot of dross  largely when the film isn t actually adapting Poe  The opening wraparound and the first story are dreary slogs  especially when the subtitles can t quite make up their mind which sister is which in the first in the Quincey themed story  Whatever the case  the one who s not narrating the story is a shrieking mess of a character  wildly exaggerated in every movement and thoroughly irritating for the fact Happily  this takes but twenty minutes of the audience s time  and then it gets to the Poe  choosing a couple of evergreen hits in The Tell Tale Heart and The Cask of Amontillado  Both contain famous French actors  the narrator of Tell Tale Heart is suspiciously similar to Jean Louis Barrault  and the Amontillado includes a lovely Jules Barry role  and tell the stories with a certain casual intimacy that befits the film  tone perfectly  They re also incredibly faithful to the tales themselves  which as a fan of the original prose I found especially pleasant  Though Hurst s 1934 Tell Tale Heart is the best  this is my fave Amontillado so far The final story includes what must be either the best Frenchman speaking French in an  English accent I ve ever seen  or the worst English actor speaking French I ve ever seen  Due to the poor information that exists on the film  I am unable to provide any clearer delineation on this  but I welcome my French speaking friends and film buffs to clear up my confusion  The story itself is a traditional crime tale  which makes sense considering the lack of supernatural elements in the Poe stories  and manages to include a great jump scare near the end that resembles a certain scene in Macbeth  Pity about the awful singing ending Not a brilliant film  certainly  but an enjoyable piece of ephemera  It s nice to see this on Netflix  no matter how strange that fact might be  and in a nice restoration at that  Worth checking out if you re a fan of the author or Franco Belgian Fantastique ,3.0,Dr. Ethan Lyon

441273,Strange Tales,1949, Segment Ratings 1st    1 22nd  The Tell Tale Heart   3rd  The Cask of Amontillado    1 24th   I love that Severin s Tales of the Uncanny was packaged with not one  not two  but three bonus movies  That s how you get me to buy a documentary I would otherwise overlook  boys  Uncanny Stories was the first I watched a while back  and like that one Strange Tales adapts the work of Edgar Allan Poe in two of its four segments   The Cask of Amontillado  is the superior of the two  with its catacombs setting really giving it a doom y air  The two non Poe stories are fairly effective too  with the first having a menacing Jack the Ripper type killer stalking women in a house at night  The wraparound ties it all together nicely  though it ends on a bizarre  fourth wall breaking moment that I m not sure if I like or not  Comes out of nowhere  and leaves you with a big ol   FIN  Thanks  movie Added to  1940s Horror   D Edward Ranks  21   55  Edgar Allan Poe   D Edward Ranks  13  23  Severin Films   D Edward Ranks  27   58 ,3.0,D Edward

441273,Strange Tales,1949, Short stories from Edgar Allan Poe  amp  Thomas De Quincey loosely combined by a discussion at a police station  And it s fine  Not that any of the stories is the quintessential adaptation of the classic tales  So one could have wished for more narrative care to make them stand out  but this wasn t exactly the greatest period for horror ,2.5,PUNQ
441273,Strange Tales,1949, aka     there isn t much reason to seek out this low key anthology but it s nice to have it as an extra feature on the         Blu Ray  For one  it isn t so much a horror film  despite containing two Poe adaptations  but more of a murder crimes anthology  The other adapted stories were unfamiliar to me and I believe they were tales that would have been familiar to French audiences  There are some slight pleasures to be had here  The first story has some chills as a serial killer traps two schoolgirls inside their room  And the adaptation of  The Tell Tale Heart  is faithful and well done  The second Poe story   The Cask of Amontillado  is less successful and shows why it is relatively little adapted for film  There just isn t much story there even for a short  The power of that story lies in Poe s descriptive language and not in the barely there plot  And the final segment  about a well liked man who is murdered  is completely predictable and aside from one great visual at its denouement  disposable  The wraparound story is merely the gendarmerie sitting around swapping these stories of cases they have worked on  Honestly  that s all I can say for the film  I m sure I will have mostly forgotten it by next week ,3.0,Michael Shawn

2440,Joint Security Area,2000, After today s historic and unprecedented meeting between North and South Korean heads of state  I couldn t help but want to rewatch Park Chan wook s masterpiece JSA I was at a business dinner a few years ago with group of folks from Samsung   We were providing a demonstration in their booth at a trade show  and they took us out to dinner to show their appreciation of us supporting them   It came up during the dinner that I was a fan of Korean cinema  and we chatted about many Korean films and directors   When I asked them what their favourite Korean film was  the answer was unanimous   JSA I could easily tell that the issues brought up in the film were very close to their heart  and that s why they loved it  as the outcome of the film gives no political favour to either side I wonder how many of them  and their countrymen  rewatched the film tonight   I have developer conferences with both Samsung and LG in mid May   Undoubtedly we ll go out to dinner  and I ll find out  I have a feeling that these will be very interesting dinners ,5.0,Jonathan White

2440,Joint Security Area,2000, After today s historic and unprecedented meeting between North and South Korean heads of state  I couldn t help but want to rewatch Park Chan wook s masterpiece JSA I was at a business dinner a few years ago with group of folks from Samsung   We were providing a demonstration in their booth at a trade show  and they took us out to dinner to show their appreciation of us supporting them   It came up during the dinner that I was a fan of Korean cinema  and we chatted about many Korean films and directors   When I asked them what their favourite Korean film was  the answer was unanimous   JSA I could easily tell that the issues brought up in the film were very close to their heart  and that s why they loved it  as the outcome of the film gives no political favour to either side I wonder how many of them  and their countrymen  rewatched the film tonight   I have developer conferences with both Samsung and LG in mid May   Undoubtedly we ll go out to dinner  and I ll find out  I have a feeling that these will be very interesting dinners ,5.0,Jonathan White
2440,Joint Security Area,2000, I know letterboxd s user base consists roughly 95  of zoomers who saw Parasite as their first ever foreign language film and it breaks my heart to see headlines like this nowadays but those of us in the know  know that Park Chan wook  gt  Bong Joon ho  Always has been  I ve seen all but one  Barking Dogs Never Bite  of Bong Joon ho s feature films and I can tell you with a high degree of certainty that not ONE of them  masterpieces that they are  made me FEEL for the characters the way that Park Chan wook did in The Handmaiden  Oldboy  and now Joint Security Area  In terms of portrayal of friendships and brotherhood on film this is easily up there with the best of John Woo and Johnnie To whom btw are the all time greats when it comes to that sort of thing  The setting of Korean DMZ and the camaraderie between the North and South Korean soldiers divided over geography and political ideologies just makes this tale all the more poignant and tragic The final shot is haunting ,4.5,Tao A

9625,The Glimmer Man,1996, Seagal and Wayans make a surprisingly good buddy pairing  especially when you consider that this was at the time Seagal decided to go full Bhuddist  The Dalai Lama apparently made him a deity  for fuck s sake  Another special pairing here is Brian Cox and Bob Gunton as sleazebags that would have rubbed Harry Calahan the wrong way  One of the last big budget Warner Bros  Seagal flicks that I d not previously seen  Happy to say that I also found a digital copy of Seagalogy  which is considered the bible for all things Seagal and should complement my ongoing trek through his filmography  I have a feeling I m not even close to being done with the guy  6 8 10,3.0,Sofa Sinema

12499,Fathers' Day,1997, As the credits of this film rolled before me  I was shocked that I had never seen this before  How had I resisted  Robin Williams  Ivan Reitman  Joel Silver  Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel   Billy Crystal  to a lesser extent  I ve loved things that all of these people had previously been involved with  so this was bound to be awesome Well  it s not awesome It s schmaltzy and sitcom y  The script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel  whose screenplays for  Parenthood  and  City Slickers  among a multitude of others  are remarkable examples of how to blend gut busting humor and highly effective sentiment  is one of their lesser works  Then again  it is based on a story by Francis Veber  who had inspired a generation s worth of high concept but middling comedies in the 1980s  This one squeaked into the late 90s  but isn t much better  The characters are very  very thin  The situations they find themselves in are dull and largely unengaging  The film s central hook  Natassja Kinski s son has ran off and she convinces two former lovers that they are really the boy s father in order to manipulate them into finding the boy for her despite the fact that the boy s real father  Bruce Greenwood  seems willing enough to track the boy down himself  is meant to be clever but comes across as stupid and insulting   So this woman is what  A manipulative bitch  And why would she rely on Billy Crystal and Robin Williams  Neither of these guys strikes me as particularly effective at tracking down and retrieving a wayward teenager  Neither of them is  Dog the Bounty Hunter  or something  If the leads of this movie were Schwarzenegger and Stallone  this plot would make more sense  So a great deal of the weight lies upon Williams and Crystal to spin this straw into gold  And they manage it a surprising amount of the time  They re engaging  inherently funny dudes and a lot of their banter is humorous  But they re still saddled with the lead weight of this dumb  dull script and it does them no favors  The situations give them very little latitude to riff from  Williams  in particular  seems to be flailing and falling back on a lot of his standard schtick  there s an interminable scene where he tries various faux  wannabe hip personalities to figure out which one would most impress a teenager  Also  the movie begins with Robin Williams attempting suicide  At one point he answers the phone with a gun in his mouth  speaking around it  Maybe this was funny in 1997 but  in light of Williams s ultimate fate  this is the furthest thing from funny now  That scene was pretty brutal to sit through  honestly  and it s almost fatal to one s enjoyment of the film  such as it is  in 2018  Still  this is an opportunity to see Robin Williams be funny and each of those feels precious to me now  He and Billy Crystal are good together  and their camaraderie overcomes the script s ample shortcomings  there is  as I suppose there must be  a sub plot involving drug dealers trying to get a large sum of money back from the wayward teen  in small  wonderful bursts  But this is a pretty by the numbers affair considering the talent involved  and not nearly as funny as it should be  The schmaltz is thick and syrupy and really smothers what little works most of the time  I probably enjoyed this more than I should have  and I found it mediocre  Also  this movie seems to think that Sugar Ray was an example of some kind of hard core punk scene which is hilariously misguided  At least there are two solid Paul McCartney songs in this movie  That helps  But  honestly  this is more evidence that Ivan Reitman s bad films far outweigh his good ones ,2.0,Dale Nauertz
12499,Fathers' Day,1997, Overshadowed by and overlooked in favour of Mrs Doubtfire  the first time I had seen the trailer for this movie  I thought to myself  what is this   amp  so off the back of that trailer  I thought it would be dumb and stupid  and that I would loathe it  Add to that a somewhat awful poster that accompanied it  negative reviews from across the board that practically trounced it to death  I didn t have high hopes for this film  so much so I had low expectations and saw it as typical Z list comedy movie fare  But man oh man  was I wrong about this movie  So wrong  Fathers  Day has the same silly  stupid  farcical humour that was in Mrs Doubtfire  and yet all of a sudden when Robin Williams dresses up as a woman  people take notice  But when he plays a character with a tragic backstory and who is much more kind hearted as Dale  audiences take no notice  It doesn t make much sense  Until they find out his character is suicidal  very much like Robin Williams himself when he was much older  I still find the suicide references and the opening scene still uncomfortable and unsettling  I was literately taken aback by that  especially as Robin had died through suicide in real life  So as coincidental as it was  even in the context of a comedy and despite it being part of the main plot  it still brought back horrible memories of his death Directed by Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters and Kindergarten Cop  and with producer   who is oddly enough  Joel Silver  who is well known for action movies such as Die Hard and Lethal Weapon  Fathers  Day was the fourth in the line of family comedy  based movies from the 1990s starring the team up of comics  amp  closest friends  Robin Williams  amp  Billy Crystal  And Robin s comedic role pretty much follows the same or otherwise  similar trademark improvisational style as seen in Aladdin as the Genie  Batty Koda in Ferngully and as Daniel Hillard Mrs Doubtfire in Mrs Doubtfire  His character routine and improv style throughout this film allows him to demonstrate his comedic acting and stand up talents that made him famous during the standup scene  on Mork  amp  Mindy and later on with Good Morning  Vietnam  Aladdin and Mrs Doubtfire  If you have seen all of Robin s comedy films  bar this one  then you need to take a look at Fathers  Day  Two men are approached on separate occasions by the same woman  an ex girlfriend from back in the day  who tells each of them that they are the father of a teenage boy named Scott  Scott has run away from home after a falling out with his parents and the mother and ex girlfriend of Dale  amp  Jack seek their help in getting him back  Some will ask why doesn t she carry out a DNA paternity test to see who the father is  but anyhow  So Dale  amp  Jack have to work together to achieve this task  whilst putting aside their differences  Scott  meanwhile  runs into some drug dealers  as well as gets involved with a girlfriend  who is not all she seems  Along the way  some silly  stupid and funny things happen in the movie  and they come courtesy of Robin Williams s Dale  He never ceases to disappoint in a comedy film  up until the 2000s that is  Be it The Survivors  Good Morning  Vietnam  The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire  as well as on TV on Mork  amp  Mindy  and with Fathers  Day  Robin didn t let me down  one bit  The plot  as unoriginal as it is  amp  is based on the French movie  Les Comperes  may not be much to write home about  but it is through Robin s improvisational scenes  silly voices and impressions and gags and the physical and slapstick comedy scenes that for any Robin Williams fan  who like me enjoys his funnier fare  Fathers  Day is a movie that they can t pass up  But in all honesty  it is Robin Williams who steals the show and of whom has the funnier scenes and lines  right from the get go  Whereas in previous year s effort  The Birdcage as Armand he was essentially playing the straight man role with Nathan Lane operating as the funny wise guy  here  Robin Williams as Dale is back to being the funny  amusing wise guy  alongside Billy Crystal as his straight man  Robin pretty much carries this movie and makes it more amusing  entertaining and watchable  Without him  it is more of a dud  as well as it isn t anywhere as good as it is with him in it  His character undergoes some lows in his life but over time  there is light at the end of the tunnel and as sad as his character is most of the time  he always tries to find humour and remains positive in the darkest of times  Robin Williams as Dale is hilarious and in a sweet way as well  And I respect that a lot   and which is indicative of Robin Williams himself  Several times I was laughing my head off whilst I was watching this film  it was just so funny  Stupid most of the time  but it was oh so amusing  I like this film way more than Mrs Doubtfire  although I still enjoy Mrs Doubtfire in small doses   amp  when I saw Fathers  Day a couple of times  I thought it was and is so hilarious and downright silly  but in a good way  Whether as Dale Robin Williams said something funny or amusing  or when something stupid happened to him  it made me laugh and smile  To me  he came across as very sympathetic  sweet  as well as funny and a much more likeable character than say Daniel from Mrs Doubtfire   I didn t really care about the other characters  apart from Jack  Billy Crystal  and his wife  Julia Louis Dreyfus  they were extremely forgettable and served as background fodder  whilst Williams  Crystal and to an extent Dreyfus were doing their own thing  There were a few scenes with Scott s father and mother  both individually and collectively  but I pretty much switched off  as I found them and son  Scott to be rather boring with no personality to speak of  I had practically no sympathy towards Scott s mother and I thought she was an awful person  Same goes for his girlfriend and the drug dealers  But the movie shines  thanks to Robin Williams  take him and his offbeat  zany antics away and you don t have much in the way of a highly amusing comedy to speak of  And it is because of Williams as Dale that he is very much let loose with his improv skills  as well as being insanely funny in the role   Despite this film being overlooked by the audience  and for those who ignored it  it is your typical standard Robin Williams comedy farce film  Much less along the lines of Good Morning  Vietnam  amp  The Best of Times  whereas 1983 s The Survivors has some of the slapstick  amp  physical comedy that can be also found in this movie   amp  but more so it is like Mrs Doubtfire  I d say they bear some similar hallmarks  Robin Williams s characters becoming the butt of jokes  Robin Williams acting goofy and silly  the slapstick  the fact they are both family comedies  And so if you liked Mrs Doubtfire a lot  I would recommend this movie  It is more of a wacky comedy and unlike Mrs Doubtfire relies less so on sentimentality and schmaltz Highlights from this movie are the penis coffee scolding scene  Jack and Dale s German banter to the band  Sugar Ray   amp  Robin Williams s funny impersonations  amp  voices  Another aspect I want to highlight that most reviewers and comments seem to ignore in their critique was the choice of music featured in this movie  Fathers Day  has a brilliant selection of tracks ranging from The Mighty Mighty Bosstones  The Impression That I Get  Paul McCartney s  Young Boy  to Sly  amp  The Family Stone s  I Wanna Take You Higher  that I m actually surprised that there wasn t an official motion picture soundtrack CD released for it  And yes so what if the humour is stupid and silly   Hello  this is based on the French film  which had exactly the same type of humour  This is what one would expect in a typical Robin Williams comedy farce type of film and a lot of the comical scenes and lines did put a smile on my face  But the humour in Fathers  Day is not by any means crude or twisted  rather it is good natured  amp  more along the lines that we laugh with Dale and Jack  as opposed to laughing at them  and so it is suitable for people of all ages  but for some of the mild language that is not suitable for very young children  Fathers  Day may lack the depth of Mrs Doubtfire  but that is just a minor issue as I base my favourite Robin Williams s film choices on the characters he plays  That and that this movie is just as funny  amp  I prefer Dale over Daniel     Though I still wished some of the scenes that featured in the original trailer that appeared for promotional use had been in the official movie  because as awful as the trailer was  there were some moments that looked interesting and would have made the film even more enjoyable than it is  just by including them  It is also one of Robin Williams s much lesser known movies   and when I say much  I meant it is so obscure  amp  as obscure as The Survivors  Club Paradise  The Best of Times  to the point that it is either ignored and or dismissed by many fans  Apart from Amazon  I ve yet to come across one single  positive  review of Fathers  Day online  it s always the usual main 5 in Good Morning  Vietnam  Mrs Doubtfire  Dead Poets Society  Hook  Good Will Hunting   amp  yet this movie rarely gets mentioned  amp  celebrated when it comes to Robin s list of works by many other fans  Especially comedy films  which is a shame really  Out of all the latter and least commercially successful movies he released towards the end of the 1990s  Fathers  Day is by far my favourite of the bunch  In some ways also  chronologically speaking Fathers  Day is and was the last ever comedy film of Robin Williams that I have thoroughly enjoyed   as almost all of his other comedy movies that ensued  post   2000 wise  have been largely disappointing affairs It gets half a mark deducted though for the suicide references and scene at the beginning of the movie with Dale  Robin Williams  An interesting concoction of parentage  responsibility  humour and confusion intertwined with some heartfelt moments  a narrative that gets more interesting as the movie progresses  as well as slapstick and comedic silliness and stupidity  Fathers  Day may not be the best comedy movie  especially coming from Robin Williams and as the plot is rather stale  But for me other than that  amp  the suicide references  that one ought to put aside or ignore completely  it is those above reasons  as well as the likeable protagonist  Dale played by Robin and his fun  light hearted and hilarious shenanigans  which makes it my favourite  amp  beloved comedy movie he has done  I loved Dale Putley After repeated  and sufferable  viewings of Mrs Doubtfire  thankfully Fathers  Day made a refreshing change  whilst providing something different as a comedy movie  Particularly for a Robin Williams comedy movie  I realise a lot of people don t like this movie  I had my worries too after seeing the trailer  fine   however  the amount of vitriol and hate this film gets and that in Fathers  Day being branded one of the worst films  ever  considering that Robin has appeared in far worst movies than this one  is staggering  Yet thank God I didn t fully buy into all the negativity and bashing it received  In one s own view  Fathers  Day served as the last  overly  decent comedy film he has ever done  Billy Crystal  Julia Louis Dreyfus and  but more so Robin Williams  makes this comedy watchable  fun and entertaining  arguably more so than the rest of the entire cast  Fathers  Day is a rip roaring  howl fest that will make you laugh a lot and crack up with sheer amusement and delight  It did that for me  If you enjoyed Mork and Mindy and Mrs Doubtfire and that particular type of slapstick  farcical and improvisational humour  then Fathers  Day will be right up your alley ranked 3rd letterboxd com misswliu81 list robin williams films i have seen ranked ,4.5,Waiching Liu

12499,Fathers' Day,1997, As the credits of this film rolled before me  I was shocked that I had never seen this before  How had I resisted  Robin Williams  Ivan Reitman  Joel Silver  Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel   Billy Crystal  to a lesser extent  I ve loved things that all of these people had previously been involved with  so this was bound to be awesome Well  it s not awesome It s schmaltzy and sitcom y  The script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel  whose screenplays for  Parenthood  and  City Slickers  among a multitude of others  are remarkable examples of how to blend gut busting humor and highly effective sentiment  is one of their lesser works  Then again  it is based on a story by Francis Veber  who had inspired a generation s worth of high concept but middling comedies in the 1980s  This one squeaked into the late 90s  but isn t much better  The characters are very  very thin  The situations they find themselves in are dull and largely unengaging  The film s central hook  Natassja Kinski s son has ran off and she convinces two former lovers that they are really the boy s father in order to manipulate them into finding the boy for her despite the fact that the boy s real father  Bruce Greenwood  seems willing enough to track the boy down himself  is meant to be clever but comes across as stupid and insulting   So this woman is what  A manipulative bitch  And why would she rely on Billy Crystal and Robin Williams  Neither of these guys strikes me as particularly effective at tracking down and retrieving a wayward teenager  Neither of them is  Dog the Bounty Hunter  or something  If the leads of this movie were Schwarzenegger and Stallone  this plot would make more sense  So a great deal of the weight lies upon Williams and Crystal to spin this straw into gold  And they manage it a surprising amount of the time  They re engaging  inherently funny dudes and a lot of their banter is humorous  But they re still saddled with the lead weight of this dumb  dull script and it does them no favors  The situations give them very little latitude to riff from  Williams  in particular  seems to be flailing and falling back on a lot of his standard schtick  there s an interminable scene where he tries various faux  wannabe hip personalities to figure out which one would most impress a teenager  Also  the movie begins with Robin Williams attempting suicide  At one point he answers the phone with a gun in his mouth  speaking around it  Maybe this was funny in 1997 but  in light of Williams s ultimate fate  this is the furthest thing from funny now  That scene was pretty brutal to sit through  honestly  and it s almost fatal to one s enjoyment of the film  such as it is  in 2018  Still  this is an opportunity to see Robin Williams be funny and each of those feels precious to me now  He and Billy Crystal are good together  and their camaraderie overcomes the script s ample shortcomings  there is  as I suppose there must be  a sub plot involving drug dealers trying to get a large sum of money back from the wayward teen  in small  wonderful bursts  But this is a pretty by the numbers affair considering the talent involved  and not nearly as funny as it should be  The schmaltz is thick and syrupy and really smothers what little works most of the time  I probably enjoyed this more than I should have  and I found it mediocre  Also  this movie seems to think that Sugar Ray was an example of some kind of hard core punk scene which is hilariously misguided  At least there are two solid Paul McCartney songs in this movie  That helps  But  honestly  this is more evidence that Ivan Reitman s bad films far outweigh his good ones ,2.0,Dale Nauertz
12499,Fathers' Day,1997, Overshadowed by and overlooked in favour of Mrs Doubtfire  the first time I had seen the trailer for this movie  I thought to myself  what is this   amp  so off the back of that trailer  I thought it would be dumb and stupid  and that I would loathe it  Add to that a somewhat awful poster that accompanied it  negative reviews from across the board that practically trounced it to death  I didn t have high hopes for this film  so much so I had low expectations and saw it as typical Z list comedy movie fare  But man oh man  was I wrong about this movie  So wrong  Fathers  Day has the same silly  stupid  farcical humour that was in Mrs Doubtfire  and yet all of a sudden when Robin Williams dresses up as a woman  people take notice  But when he plays a character with a tragic backstory and who is much more kind hearted as Dale  audiences take no notice  It doesn t make much sense  Until they find out his character is suicidal  very much like Robin Williams himself when he was much older  I still find the suicide references and the opening scene still uncomfortable and unsettling  I was literately taken aback by that  especially as Robin had died through suicide in real life  So as coincidental as it was  even in the context of a comedy and despite it being part of the main plot  it still brought back horrible memories of his death Directed by Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters and Kindergarten Cop  and with producer   who is oddly enough  Joel Silver  who is well known for action movies such as Die Hard and Lethal Weapon  Fathers  Day was the fourth in the line of family comedy  based movies from the 1990s starring the team up of comics  amp  closest friends  Robin Williams  amp  Billy Crystal  And Robin s comedic role pretty much follows the same or otherwise  similar trademark improvisational style as seen in Aladdin as the Genie  Batty Koda in Ferngully and as Daniel Hillard Mrs Doubtfire in Mrs Doubtfire  His character routine and improv style throughout this film allows him to demonstrate his comedic acting and stand up talents that made him famous during the standup scene  on Mork  amp  Mindy and later on with Good Morning  Vietnam  Aladdin and Mrs Doubtfire  If you have seen all of Robin s comedy films  bar this one  then you need to take a look at Fathers  Day  Two men are approached on separate occasions by the same woman  an ex girlfriend from back in the day  who tells each of them that they are the father of a teenage boy named Scott  Scott has run away from home after a falling out with his parents and the mother and ex girlfriend of Dale  amp  Jack seek their help in getting him back  Some will ask why doesn t she carry out a DNA paternity test to see who the father is  but anyhow  So Dale  amp  Jack have to work together to achieve this task  whilst putting aside their differences  Scott  meanwhile  runs into some drug dealers  as well as gets involved with a girlfriend  who is not all she seems  Along the way  some silly  stupid and funny things happen in the movie  and they come courtesy of Robin Williams s Dale  He never ceases to disappoint in a comedy film  up until the 2000s that is  Be it The Survivors  Good Morning  Vietnam  The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire  as well as on TV on Mork  amp  Mindy  and with Fathers  Day  Robin didn t let me down  one bit  The plot  as unoriginal as it is  amp  is based on the French movie  Les Comperes  may not be much to write home about  but it is through Robin s improvisational scenes  silly voices and impressions and gags and the physical and slapstick comedy scenes that for any Robin Williams fan  who like me enjoys his funnier fare  Fathers  Day is a movie that they can t pass up  But in all honesty  it is Robin Williams who steals the show and of whom has the funnier scenes and lines  right from the get go  Whereas in previous year s effort  The Birdcage as Armand he was essentially playing the straight man role with Nathan Lane operating as the funny wise guy  here  Robin Williams as Dale is back to being the funny  amusing wise guy  alongside Billy Crystal as his straight man  Robin pretty much carries this movie and makes it more amusing  entertaining and watchable  Without him  it is more of a dud  as well as it isn t anywhere as good as it is with him in it  His character undergoes some lows in his life but over time  there is light at the end of the tunnel and as sad as his character is most of the time  he always tries to find humour and remains positive in the darkest of times  Robin Williams as Dale is hilarious and in a sweet way as well  And I respect that a lot   and which is indicative of Robin Williams himself  Several times I was laughing my head off whilst I was watching this film  it was just so funny  Stupid most of the time  but it was oh so amusing  I like this film way more than Mrs Doubtfire  although I still enjoy Mrs Doubtfire in small doses   amp  when I saw Fathers  Day a couple of times  I thought it was and is so hilarious and downright silly  but in a good way  Whether as Dale Robin Williams said something funny or amusing  or when something stupid happened to him  it made me laugh and smile  To me  he came across as very sympathetic  sweet  as well as funny and a much more likeable character than say Daniel from Mrs Doubtfire   I didn t really care about the other characters  apart from Jack  Billy Crystal  and his wife  Julia Louis Dreyfus  they were extremely forgettable and served as background fodder  whilst Williams  Crystal and to an extent Dreyfus were doing their own thing  There were a few scenes with Scott s father and mother  both individually and collectively  but I pretty much switched off  as I found them and son  Scott to be rather boring with no personality to speak of  I had practically no sympathy towards Scott s mother and I thought she was an awful person  Same goes for his girlfriend and the drug dealers  But the movie shines  thanks to Robin Williams  take him and his offbeat  zany antics away and you don t have much in the way of a highly amusing comedy to speak of  And it is because of Williams as Dale that he is very much let loose with his improv skills  as well as being insanely funny in the role   Despite this film being overlooked by the audience  and for those who ignored it  it is your typical standard Robin Williams comedy farce film  Much less along the lines of Good Morning  Vietnam  amp  The Best of Times  whereas 1983 s The Survivors has some of the slapstick  amp  physical comedy that can be also found in this movie   amp  but more so it is like Mrs Doubtfire  I d say they bear some similar hallmarks  Robin Williams s characters becoming the butt of jokes  Robin Williams acting goofy and silly  the slapstick  the fact they are both family comedies  And so if you liked Mrs Doubtfire a lot  I would recommend this movie  It is more of a wacky comedy and unlike Mrs Doubtfire relies less so on sentimentality and schmaltz Highlights from this movie are the penis coffee scolding scene  Jack and Dale s German banter to the band  Sugar Ray   amp  Robin Williams s funny impersonations  amp  voices  Another aspect I want to highlight that most reviewers and comments seem to ignore in their critique was the choice of music featured in this movie  Fathers Day  has a brilliant selection of tracks ranging from The Mighty Mighty Bosstones  The Impression That I Get  Paul McCartney s  Young Boy  to Sly  amp  The Family Stone s  I Wanna Take You Higher  that I m actually surprised that there wasn t an official motion picture soundtrack CD released for it  And yes so what if the humour is stupid and silly   Hello  this is based on the French film  which had exactly the same type of humour  This is what one would expect in a typical Robin Williams comedy farce type of film and a lot of the comical scenes and lines did put a smile on my face  But the humour in Fathers  Day is not by any means crude or twisted  rather it is good natured  amp  more along the lines that we laugh with Dale and Jack  as opposed to laughing at them  and so it is suitable for people of all ages  but for some of the mild language that is not suitable for very young children  Fathers  Day may lack the depth of Mrs Doubtfire  but that is just a minor issue as I base my favourite Robin Williams s film choices on the characters he plays  That and that this movie is just as funny  amp  I prefer Dale over Daniel     Though I still wished some of the scenes that featured in the original trailer that appeared for promotional use had been in the official movie  because as awful as the trailer was  there were some moments that looked interesting and would have made the film even more enjoyable than it is  just by including them  It is also one of Robin Williams s much lesser known movies   and when I say much  I meant it is so obscure  amp  as obscure as The Survivors  Club Paradise  The Best of Times  to the point that it is either ignored and or dismissed by many fans  Apart from Amazon  I ve yet to come across one single  positive  review of Fathers  Day online  it s always the usual main 5 in Good Morning  Vietnam  Mrs Doubtfire  Dead Poets Society  Hook  Good Will Hunting   amp  yet this movie rarely gets mentioned  amp  celebrated when it comes to Robin s list of works by many other fans  Especially comedy films  which is a shame really  Out of all the latter and least commercially successful movies he released towards the end of the 1990s  Fathers  Day is by far my favourite of the bunch  In some ways also  chronologically speaking Fathers  Day is and was the last ever comedy film of Robin Williams that I have thoroughly enjoyed   as almost all of his other comedy movies that ensued  post   2000 wise  have been largely disappointing affairs It gets half a mark deducted though for the suicide references and scene at the beginning of the movie with Dale  Robin Williams  An interesting concoction of parentage  responsibility  humour and confusion intertwined with some heartfelt moments  a narrative that gets more interesting as the movie progresses  as well as slapstick and comedic silliness and stupidity  Fathers  Day may not be the best comedy movie  especially coming from Robin Williams and as the plot is rather stale  But for me other than that  amp  the suicide references  that one ought to put aside or ignore completely  it is those above reasons  as well as the likeable protagonist  Dale played by Robin and his fun  light hearted and hilarious shenanigans  which makes it my favourite  amp  beloved comedy movie he has done  I loved Dale Putley After repeated  and sufferable  viewings of Mrs Doubtfire  thankfully Fathers  Day made a refreshing change  whilst providing something different as a comedy movie  Particularly for a Robin Williams comedy movie  I realise a lot of people don t like this movie  I had my worries too after seeing the trailer  fine   however  the amount of vitriol and hate this film gets and that in Fathers  Day being branded one of the worst films  ever  considering that Robin has appeared in far worst movies than this one  is staggering  Yet thank God I didn t fully buy into all the negativity and bashing it received  In one s own view  Fathers  Day served as the last  overly  decent comedy film he has ever done  Billy Crystal  Julia Louis Dreyfus and  but more so Robin Williams  makes this comedy watchable  fun and entertaining  arguably more so than the rest of the entire cast  Fathers  Day is a rip roaring  howl fest that will make you laugh a lot and crack up with sheer amusement and delight  It did that for me  If you enjoyed Mork and Mindy and Mrs Doubtfire and that particular type of slapstick  farcical and improvisational humour  then Fathers  Day will be right up your alley ranked 3rd letterboxd com misswliu81 list robin williams films i have seen ranked ,4.5,Waiching Liu

12499,Fathers' Day,1997, This movie runs on the sheer charisma of its two legendary leads  because the writing is borderline terrible   The jokes are too big  not very funny  and the film just never really settles itself into a likeable format   It s really disappointing because with Ivan Reitman directing  Lowell Ganz  amp  Babaloo Mandell writing  Night Shift  Parenthood  City Slickers  A League of Their Own  and Williams  amp  Crystal as stars  you d think the result would be comedy gold   sadly that is not the case   It s also one of those movies like Father Figures that is built as a comedy but then also expects you to care about the characters in a genuine way  and soften into the dramatic   heartfelt  notes   I would actually say Father Figures was more successful at that   The tone is just all over the place  and while there are a few moments of good material  the majority is just a waste of time ,2.0,Learic Life

986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, Welles is perhaps the greatest amateur in cinema  having never learned to  properly  direct because of the artistic success of Citizen Kane  His camera placements are always off in some way  actors are pushed too close in  the angle much too slanted  the sight lines mismatched  Characters jump off screen and then back into place without reason  and spatial relations are constantly shifting with motivation  Actors deliver Shakespearean dialogue much too pointedly  as if they were still on the stage any no sense for the camera  There s too much love paid to the bombastic sets and some of the cuts take away from poignant moments in which the camera should simply rest  Shots are either filled with too much information that allows the negative space to act its own drama  or all too pointed toward a single focal direction But this critique of Welles on a form of cinema that is narratively or thematically efficient  I couldn t help but recalling filmmakers like Alex Ross Perry who choose the great shot because it is the great shot  Not the prettiest or most  um  perfect shot  but the one that transcends its own pictorial beauty and simply seems to enact a life of its own  To appreciate Welles as a filmmaker is to appreciate someone whose cinema feels untied to the system  whatever system we may want to consider  The biggest action scene is pretty much incomprehensible on a spatial comprehension level  but each cut registers with a visceral impact  with the shots of the oafish Welles in that hilarious fat armor throwing us off in our emotional response  Welles didn t always master his own form I found his Othello too focused on its architectural locations  missing the rhythms of the drama but when he did  it was because he finds something living in every image and sound  This is an unwieldy movie by design  five Shakespeare crunched into one  focused on the minor character of the fool who thought he was the most powerful of all  much like Charles Foster Kane Watching the film again  I was utterly taken with a moment during the opening credits  where Welles focuses on a soldier who loses his hat while marching and must dash back for it in the wind  Leaving that awkward mistake in feels like the quintessential Welles moment  not one of perfection  but a search for something ethereal that seems beyond our usual discussions of cinema ,4.5,Peter Labuza

986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, What a sublime pleasure it is to see this film restored  to be able to appreciate its wild beauty  itself a magnificent achievement given Welles s ludicrous setbacks and pauses in filming  to the fullest expression and to see that Orson truly was that bitch  Welles s Shakespeare adaptation perfected the balance between theatrical opulence  revisionist grit and filth  and the freer possibilities of cinema  and Chimes at Midnight is the ultimate synthesis of these traits  The movie and its characters are caked in dirt and clothed in rags  its humor drags all the common vulgarity out of Shakespeare s text  and for all the political machinations of holding power one is  as in both Welles s and Roman Polanski s adaptations of Macbeth  left to wonder why anyone would want to rule this untamed  barely hospitable land and its ignorant and filthy subjects so badly Yet it is also an opulent feature  from Welles s ever daring camera angles and movements to the filmmaker s own depiction of Falstaff  which is so literally and metaphorically massive that the entire film seems to expand to fit him  Welles plays Falstaff as a figure of expressionistic gregariousness  a giant barrel of sack of a man who sloshes with every step and who is so ruddy faced you can practically see the scarlet in his cheeks in black and white  But Welles also complicates the lovable coward by pitching him as a kind of Cyrano figure  only in this case he helps an attractive young cohort not to displace romantic frustrations but political ones  For all of Falstaff s cowardice and bluster  he gives a keen sense of political awareness and a subtle indication that he not only wants a measure of true power but would wield it shrewdly  His rejection at the hands of his prot g  at the end cuts so deeply As such  Welles films Falstaff s environs as magnificently as he does the vaulted ceilings of Henry IV s castle  The Boar s Head Inn is shot with angles so low that the ceiling looks 30 feet tall  and Falstaff holds court in it like a monarch  The wild close ups and ever moving camera add to the sense of constant conniving and surreptitious conversation  and the Battle of Shrewsbury is cinema s first great revisionist battle sequence  picking up where the one sided massacre of Potemkin left off to depict war as nought but chaos and terror  with the sight of Falstaff waddling between hiding places hilarious but also the only truly intelligent action on the battlefield ,5.0,Jake Cole

986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, A love film and by consequence one taken by unbearable pain  It is full Welles while at same time toning down a lot of his most known tics  part because the story speaks so deeply to him  part because after staying the period between Lady from Shanghai and The Trial trying to take a baroque account of a post war world whose comprehension disgusts him  he is back in Ambersons territory making a melancholic pastoral of a time condemned to slip by  It is mostly an achievement of place and character and how they complement each other  There s lots of things that are amazing in it  that battle scene  the tavern moments  all those exterior shots  the scenes when Gielgud is around and the movie father son drama suddenly shifts into one about will and power  the way Welles pet theme of pressure of time is deployed  Hal s big rejection scene  as effective a dramatic moment as there s in a Welles movie  and the fat man joyful smile which I always take with me  Whatever it is on  it does feel like the most beautiful movie  Welles loved the theatre  and he loved the words and the character of Falstaff  he had literally toyed with this material since he was 15  but there s something about the achievement here  of how it allows to fight the inevitability of progress that only the permanence of movie image can quite allow ,5.0,Filipe Furtado
986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, 77 100Really glad I finally got to see this properly restored  as the print I caught back in  99 was beat up almost to the point of being unwatchable   Same is true of The Trial  which will hopefully also turn up in better condition soon  Now I can appreciate just how astounding Welles made the film look on a negligible budget  mostly by shooting from a distance in magnificent locations  As a bonus  this monumental aesthetic also makes the post sync sound somewhat less distracting  though the disjunction between words and mouths still bugs me  as it does in virtually every Italian film from this period  That objection aside  Chimes ranks alongside Welles  Othello among the great Shakespeare adaptations  even if it peaks early with the brilliantly edited  shockingly modern Battle of Shrewsbury partly because Shakespeare wisely made that the climax of Henry IV  Part 1  the splitting tactic dates back centuries  partly because Part 2 simply isn t as strong a play  Loved Welles  creative throughline  too  e g  making Falstaff the subject of Harry s pardon from Henry V  A much  much better film than I could perceive 17 years ago  and while my taste has unquestionably matured in the meantime  the quality of the presentation matters  too ,4.0,Mike D'Angelo

986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, Welles is perhaps the greatest amateur in cinema  having never learned to  properly  direct because of the artistic success of Citizen Kane  His camera placements are always off in some way  actors are pushed too close in  the angle much too slanted  the sight lines mismatched  Characters jump off screen and then back into place without reason  and spatial relations are constantly shifting with motivation  Actors deliver Shakespearean dialogue much too pointedly  as if they were still on the stage any no sense for the camera  There s too much love paid to the bombastic sets and some of the cuts take away from poignant moments in which the camera should simply rest  Shots are either filled with too much information that allows the negative space to act its own drama  or all too pointed toward a single focal direction But this critique of Welles on a form of cinema that is narratively or thematically efficient  I couldn t help but recalling filmmakers like Alex Ross Perry who choose the great shot because it is the great shot  Not the prettiest or most  um  perfect shot  but the one that transcends its own pictorial beauty and simply seems to enact a life of its own  To appreciate Welles as a filmmaker is to appreciate someone whose cinema feels untied to the system  whatever system we may want to consider  The biggest action scene is pretty much incomprehensible on a spatial comprehension level  but each cut registers with a visceral impact  with the shots of the oafish Welles in that hilarious fat armor throwing us off in our emotional response  Welles didn t always master his own form I found his Othello too focused on its architectural locations  missing the rhythms of the drama but when he did  it was because he finds something living in every image and sound  This is an unwieldy movie by design  five Shakespeare crunched into one  focused on the minor character of the fool who thought he was the most powerful of all  much like Charles Foster Kane Watching the film again  I was utterly taken with a moment during the opening credits  where Welles focuses on a soldier who loses his hat while marching and must dash back for it in the wind  Leaving that awkward mistake in feels like the quintessential Welles moment  not one of perfection  but a search for something ethereal that seems beyond our usual discussions of cinema ,4.5,Peter Labuza
986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, As many fat jokes as Nutty Professor 2  The Klumps but with an extended battle sequence largely shot by second unit director Jess Franco  not sure who directed the one in NP2TK  Also not sure why Orson Welles was attracted to a story about a wise but hedonistic fool of considerable girth who in his lifetime told fantastic stories that gained him the respect of mischievous young men but by the time of his death was unrecognized and misunderstood  Not sure about so much in this life ,4.0,laird
986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, Genuinely can t stop laughing over one of the trivia for this movie that goes  Despite portraying Falstaff as a grossly obese man  Orson Welles actually had to diet to slim down for the role  Dude is living his best life in the 60s 70s my god,4.0,BananaPudding
986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, What a sublime pleasure it is to see this film restored  to be able to appreciate its wild beauty  itself a magnificent achievement given Welles s ludicrous setbacks and pauses in filming  to the fullest expression and to see that Orson truly was that bitch  Welles s Shakespeare adaptation perfected the balance between theatrical opulence  revisionist grit and filth  and the freer possibilities of cinema  and Chimes at Midnight is the ultimate synthesis of these traits  The movie and its characters are caked in dirt and clothed in rags  its humor drags all the common vulgarity out of Shakespeare s text  and for all the political machinations of holding power one is  as in both Welles s and Roman Polanski s adaptations of Macbeth  left to wonder why anyone would want to rule this untamed  barely hospitable land and its ignorant and filthy subjects so badly Yet it is also an opulent feature  from Welles s ever daring camera angles and movements to the filmmaker s own depiction of Falstaff  which is so literally and metaphorically massive that the entire film seems to expand to fit him  Welles plays Falstaff as a figure of expressionistic gregariousness  a giant barrel of sack of a man who sloshes with every step and who is so ruddy faced you can practically see the scarlet in his cheeks in black and white  But Welles also complicates the lovable coward by pitching him as a kind of Cyrano figure  only in this case he helps an attractive young cohort not to displace romantic frustrations but political ones  For all of Falstaff s cowardice and bluster  he gives a keen sense of political awareness and a subtle indication that he not only wants a measure of true power but would wield it shrewdly  His rejection at the hands of his prot g  at the end cuts so deeply As such  Welles films Falstaff s environs as magnificently as he does the vaulted ceilings of Henry IV s castle  The Boar s Head Inn is shot with angles so low that the ceiling looks 30 feet tall  and Falstaff holds court in it like a monarch  The wild close ups and ever moving camera add to the sense of constant conniving and surreptitious conversation  and the Battle of Shrewsbury is cinema s first great revisionist battle sequence  picking up where the one sided massacre of Potemkin left off to depict war as nought but chaos and terror  with the sight of Falstaff waddling between hiding places hilarious but also the only truly intelligent action on the battlefield ,5.0,Jake Cole

986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, Orson Welles fought his entire career to play this role  a great big fatso Enfeoff d himself to popularity That  being daily swallow d by men s eyes They surfeited with honey and beganTo loathe the taste of sweetness  whereof a littleMore than a little is by much too much So when he had occasion to be seen He was but as the cuckoo is in June Heard  not regarded  seen  but with such eyesAs  sick and blunted with community Afford no extraordinary gaze Such as is bent on sun like majestyWhen it shines seldom in admiring eyes But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down Slept in his face and render d such aspectAs cloudy men use to their adversaries Being with his presence glutted  gorged and full And in that very line  Harry  standest thou For thou has lost thy princely privilegeWith vile participation  not an eyeBut is a weary of thy common sight Save mine  which hath desired to see thee more Which now doth that I would not have it do Make blind itself with foolish tenderness This passage from King Henry IV to Prince Hal speaks to me about the burden of being a big account on Twitter ,4.0,Will Menaker

986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, A love film and by consequence one taken by unbearable pain  It is full Welles while at same time toning down a lot of his most known tics  part because the story speaks so deeply to him  part because after staying the period between Lady from Shanghai and The Trial trying to take a baroque account of a post war world whose comprehension disgusts him  he is back in Ambersons territory making a melancholic pastoral of a time condemned to slip by  It is mostly an achievement of place and character and how they complement each other  There s lots of things that are amazing in it  that battle scene  the tavern moments  all those exterior shots  the scenes when Gielgud is around and the movie father son drama suddenly shifts into one about will and power  the way Welles pet theme of pressure of time is deployed  Hal s big rejection scene  as effective a dramatic moment as there s in a Welles movie  and the fat man joyful smile which I always take with me  Whatever it is on  it does feel like the most beautiful movie  Welles loved the theatre  and he loved the words and the character of Falstaff  he had literally toyed with this material since he was 15  but there s something about the achievement here  of how it allows to fight the inevitability of progress that only the permanence of movie image can quite allow ,5.0,Filipe Furtado
986,Chimes at Midnight,1965, 77 100Really glad I finally got to see this properly restored  as the print I caught back in  99 was beat up almost to the point of being unwatchable   Same is true of The Trial  which will hopefully also turn up in better condition soon  Now I can appreciate just how astounding Welles made the film look on a negligible budget  mostly by shooting from a distance in magnificent locations  As a bonus  this monumental aesthetic also makes the post sync sound somewhat less distracting  though the disjunction between words and mouths still bugs me  as it does in virtually every Italian film from this period  That objection aside  Chimes ranks alongside Welles  Othello among the great Shakespeare adaptations  even if it peaks early with the brilliantly edited  shockingly modern Battle of Shrewsbury partly because Shakespeare wisely made that the climax of Henry IV  Part 1  the splitting tactic dates back centuries  partly because Part 2 simply isn t as strong a play  Loved Welles  creative throughline  too  e g  making Falstaff the subject of Harry s pardon from Henry V  A much  much better film than I could perceive 17 years ago  and while my taste has unquestionably matured in the meantime  the quality of the presentation matters  too ,4.0,Mike D'Angelo

515001,Jojo Rabbit,2019, You re not a Nazi  Jojo  You re a ten year old kid  who likes swastikas and likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club  But you are not one of them If there s one thing we ve learned from the past couple years  it s that people are all too willing to make excuses for Nazis  Whether from the left  right  or center  we hear it constantly  Nazis aren t so bad  They re just people with different opinions  They aren t dangerous  They aren t even Nazis  and saying they are is what s really offensive  So I think a Jewish artist is presented with a responsibility  We can t make compromises on depicting Nazis  The scope of the Holocaust is so titanic that any obligation to  nuance  is superseded  There were no good Nazis  With Jojo Rabbit  Taika Waititi fully and flagrantly abdicates his responsibility as a Jewish artist in favor of disgraceful  vomit inducing Nazi kitsch  And he shamefully uses his heritage as a label to hide behind in order to get away with it The film reveals its hideousness early  Scrawny ten year old Jojo  for whom Hitler is an imaginary friend  lives in Germany in the waning days of World War II  As the film begins  he heads off to a Hitler Youth summer camp  Waititi depicts the camp with a Wes Andersonian whimsy  the first sign of the way in which he takes for granted the audience s anti Nazi sympathies  He s like the YouTuber who says the N word and cries  I m not racist  the joke is that I would never say something like that  These scenes are coupled with horrific comic performances from Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson as Nazi leaders  Here  the joke is different  We re meant to laugh at their oafish stupidity  Is this the best that this  anti hate satire  can muster in comedic critique   Nazis are dumb  that s all  This is classic toothless liberal satire  the kind Jon Stewart perfected a decade and a half ago  Fascists can t be treated as evil  because that would make lighthearted comedy an obviously useless tool of resistance  But if we call them stupid instead  we can joke about how stupid they are  and take the high ground  and act like it fucking matters  like these people have ever cared if the left thinks they re dumb  This is how Waititi treats the perpetrators of mankind s most monstrous act  Not as bad guys  just fancifully silly ones  The film s most infuriating element  to me  is that their anti Semitism is treated as just part of the gag  I m not sure I ve ever been so angry watching a movie as I was listening to an audience howl with laughter at the deluge of anti Semitic remarks  Were they laughing at the Nazis for being stupid enough to believe such things  Or were they laughing at the shock of hearing them out loud  Perhaps it was because they were hearing some of these ideas for the first time  I can t say I shared that experience This  finally  is how you get the quote I opened this post with  That line comes from the mouth of Elsa  a young Jewish girl being hidden by Jojo s mother  This girl who has probably watched her entire family be packed in cattle cars and shipped off to be murdered views a young Hitler fanatic not as an object of both immediate and existential terror  but as a wounded little bird whose ideology she can nurse back to health  When Jojo first discovers her  Waititi shoots her like a horror movie monster  slowly sliding her fingers around doorframes and viciously stalking the young boy through his house  Eventually she physically attacks him and threatens to murder him  This is not the righteous vengeance of Inglourious Basterds  it s just a vile misappropriation of broadly familiar imagery of Holocaust survivors  I m sure Waititi thinks he s being quite provocative and edgy with these scenes  I think he s being irresponsible  This is even less forgiveable once you ve seen how the rest of the film treats Elsa  There s no trace of Judaism in her character or perspective that I can recognize  There is only the milquetoast sentimentality of a liberal all to eager to forgive monsters  In fact  for all the defenses of Waititi s right as a  Jewish director  to make Jojo Rabbit  this is by no means a Jewish film  It s not for Jews  it s not about Jews  it doesn t speak to our values or teachings or culture  It does do all of those things for Nazis  So I m calling this a Nazi film  instead edit  i expanded on these thoughts in this article for my blog  i hope you read estheronfilm com 2020 02 13 my final words on jojo rabbit ,0.5,esther

515001,Jojo Rabbit,2019, You re not a Nazi  Jojo  You re a ten year old kid  who likes swastikas and likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club  But you are not one of them If there s one thing we ve learned from the past couple years  it s that people are all too willing to make excuses for Nazis  Whether from the left  right  or center  we hear it constantly  Nazis aren t so bad  They re just people with different opinions  They aren t dangerous  They aren t even Nazis  and saying they are is what s really offensive  So I think a Jewish artist is presented with a responsibility  We can t make compromises on depicting Nazis  The scope of the Holocaust is so titanic that any obligation to  nuance  is superseded  There were no good Nazis  With Jojo Rabbit  Taika Waititi fully and flagrantly abdicates his responsibility as a Jewish artist in favor of disgraceful  vomit inducing Nazi kitsch  And he shamefully uses his heritage as a label to hide behind in order to get away with it The film reveals its hideousness early  Scrawny ten year old Jojo  for whom Hitler is an imaginary friend  lives in Germany in the waning days of World War II  As the film begins  he heads off to a Hitler Youth summer camp  Waititi depicts the camp with a Wes Andersonian whimsy  the first sign of the way in which he takes for granted the audience s anti Nazi sympathies  He s like the YouTuber who says the N word and cries  I m not racist  the joke is that I would never say something like that  These scenes are coupled with horrific comic performances from Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson as Nazi leaders  Here  the joke is different  We re meant to laugh at their oafish stupidity  Is this the best that this  anti hate satire  can muster in comedic critique   Nazis are dumb  that s all  This is classic toothless liberal satire  the kind Jon Stewart perfected a decade and a half ago  Fascists can t be treated as evil  because that would make lighthearted comedy an obviously useless tool of resistance  But if we call them stupid instead  we can joke about how stupid they are  and take the high ground  and act like it fucking matters  like these people have ever cared if the left thinks they re dumb  This is how Waititi treats the perpetrators of mankind s most monstrous act  Not as bad guys  just fancifully silly ones  The film s most infuriating element  to me  is that their anti Semitism is treated as just part of the gag  I m not sure I ve ever been so angry watching a movie as I was listening to an audience howl with laughter at the deluge of anti Semitic remarks  Were they laughing at the Nazis for being stupid enough to believe such things  Or were they laughing at the shock of hearing them out loud  Perhaps it was because they were hearing some of these ideas for the first time  I can t say I shared that experience This  finally  is how you get the quote I opened this post with  That line comes from the mouth of Elsa  a young Jewish girl being hidden by Jojo s mother  This girl who has probably watched her entire family be packed in cattle cars and shipped off to be murdered views a young Hitler fanatic not as an object of both immediate and existential terror  but as a wounded little bird whose ideology she can nurse back to health  When Jojo first discovers her  Waititi shoots her like a horror movie monster  slowly sliding her fingers around doorframes and viciously stalking the young boy through his house  Eventually she physically attacks him and threatens to murder him  This is not the righteous vengeance of Inglourious Basterds  it s just a vile misappropriation of broadly familiar imagery of Holocaust survivors  I m sure Waititi thinks he s being quite provocative and edgy with these scenes  I think he s being irresponsible  This is even less forgiveable once you ve seen how the rest of the film treats Elsa  There s no trace of Judaism in her character or perspective that I can recognize  There is only the milquetoast sentimentality of a liberal all to eager to forgive monsters  In fact  for all the defenses of Waititi s right as a  Jewish director  to make Jojo Rabbit  this is by no means a Jewish film  It s not for Jews  it s not about Jews  it doesn t speak to our values or teachings or culture  It does do all of those things for Nazis  So I m calling this a Nazi film  instead edit  i expanded on these thoughts in this article for my blog  i hope you read estheronfilm com 2020 02 13 my final words on jojo rabbit ,0.5,esther

14241,7 Faces of Dr. Lao,1964, Surely one of the strangest films commissioned in Hollywood  even in the 60s when films like Casino Royale and Skidoo were around and this film becomes more absurd and interesting that it has any right to be  After setting up a rather hokey Western town that feels dated even in 1964  it changes into next gear as a magical circus comes to town  and inside is a strange cinematic zone that defies space and geometry with a host of characters  a minotaur  a medusa  a fortune teller  an abominable snowman  a snake and a magician   all played by Randall   that change the lives of the townspeople in this weird phantasmagoric  anticapitalist and anti conformist fever dream  It doesn t all work  but inspired and batty  curios like these are what us cinephiles live for ,3.5,b rad
14241,7 Faces of Dr. Lao,1964, I ll start with what is probably the most sensitive part of this otherwise very playful fantasy  race   Specifically  Tony Randall cast as a Chinese man  ugh   I definitely had my antennae up and thought  oh  here we go when he started off with a stereotypical accent when his elderly character arrives in a Western town   However  later we find out that he speaks perfect English  just feigning the accent in certain situations as a parody of it  and that he s highly intelligent  caring  and philosophical as well   It s not a Mickey Rooney   Breakfast at Tiffany s situation at all  and good lord that was bad   There is certainly racism in the yellowface casting  which is another example of the shame that plagued Hollywood from its inception to the present day  until this generation finally kicked the door open at least a little further   But in the script  role  and performance  I didn t perceive overt racism   And  on the positive side of the things  the small Native American part was played by a Native American  Eddie Little Sky  and it s a sympathetic role   we see the bullying and taunting he stoically puts up with in an early scene Next let me just say that the film has perhaps the best fortune told ever Tomorrow will be like today  and the day after tomorrow will be like the day before yesterday   I see your remaining days as a tedious collection of hours full of useless vanities  You will think no new thoughts   You will forget what little you have known   Older you will become  but not wiser   Stiffer  but not more dignified  Childless you are  and childless you will remain   Of that suppleness you once commanded in your youth  of that strange simplicity which once attracted men to you  neither endures  nor shall you recapture them    When you die  you will be buried and forgotten  and that is all   And for all the good or evil  creation or destruction  your living might have accomplished  you might just as well never have lived at all Damn   That was spoken in world weary tones by one of Randall s persona in the film  the ancient Greek Apollonius of Tyana  and it s the kind of thing that added real meaning to a strange film that meanders in all sorts of directions   Dr  Lao also holds up a mirror to several things happening in the town  aided by the rest of his entourage of strange creatures people  Medusa  Pan  a talking serpent  the abominable snowman  Merlin  and the Loch Ness Monster   Oh  and Lao is 7 322 years old and has real magical powers  did I mention that   He s a whimsical  mystical version of a classic character in the Western genre  the stranger who arrives at a time of crisis   In this case  the bad guy isn t a gunslinger who intimidates the town with a scowl and an itchy trigger finger  it s a rich businessman with a smile on his face  but misanthropy in his heart   How   relevant So that s the primary thing that needs the good doctor s help  the fact that the townsfolk are being hoodwinked into selling their property to this guy  which he wants because he knows there are plans to put a railroad through the town  which will increase its value   In a subplot  a young widow  Barbara Eden  is lonely but can t see love from a decent  though annoyingly persistent  man right in front of her  John Ericson  that is  until her passion is kindled while listening to Pan play his flute and dance deliriously about   The rich man  Arthur O Connell  himself needs help  though he doesn t know it  he once had high ideals  but now believes  There s no such thing as the dignity of man  Man is a base  pathetic and vulgar animal   And lastly  the widow s son is a sweet 8 year old who believes he s grown up enough to join the circus  which Lao must gently disabuse him of   To this he says The whole world is a circus if you know how to look at it  The way the sun goes down when you re tired  comes up when you want to be on the move  That s real magic  The way a leaf grows  The song of the birds  The way the desert looks at night  with the moon embracing it  Oh  my boy  that s  that s circus enough for anyone  Every time you watch a rainbow and feel wonder in your heart  Every time you pick up a handful of dust  and see not the dust  but a mystery  a marvel  there in your hand  Every time you stop and think   I m alive  and being alive is fantastic   Every time such a thing happens  you re part of the Circus of Dr  Lao There s some schmaltz there  but wisdom too   Director George Pal also gives us some pretty cool stop motion special effects  giving the film camp value   All of the elements it blends makes it a pretty unique film  and Randall does well in his various roles   I think it would be a good film to watch with kids  maybe with a discussion about race afterwards   And  it would be a good film to remake  with an Asian American in the lead role  and some other updates   For example  there s not enough abominable snowman ,3.5,AntoniusBlock7

14241,7 Faces of Dr. Lao,1964, The 1960s  Pt  II  2 1001964 RankedAs Ben Mankiewicz notes in his introduction  7 Faces of Dr  Lao is a challenging film to approach in modern times  It is wonderful at times with a considerable human spirit at its core that powers it through with a moving message  It is also a film with Tony Randall playing an Asian man  Dr  Lao  He also plays six other characters of varying races  but is mostly seen as this Dr  Lao  He speaks in broken English and an exaggerated accent at times   partially  it seems to be in order to meet expectations of the whites  as he often slips into speaking without an accent   with one cringing at each utterance  If one s mileage for such dated and racist portrayals is limited  then the 7 Faces of Dr  Lao will leave one too busy recoiling to find any enjoyment  In a sign of the change in the past 57 years  make up artist William Tuttle even won an honorary Oscar for his work in disguising Randall  both as Lao and the other characters he plays  Some cinematic changes have certainly been for the worse  but rightly seeing the wrongheadedness and racism that guided casting Tony Randall as Dr  Lao is a good change  That said  the 7 Faces of Dr  Lao is an otherwise enjoyable film with a huge heart As the final narration points out  this is a story of wonder and reflection  It is partially a story of hard  revelatory truths about oneself but also a story of finding joy in the smallest things   The world is a circus  proclaims Dr  Lao  urging young Michael  Kevin Tate  to find happiness in the grains of sand all around him  In riding into a small Arizona town with a circus in tow  Dr  Lao arrives right as he is needed  Angela  Barbara Eden  is a widow  raising Michael with her mother in law  and fighting off loneliness though she is too afraid to get married again  Ed Cunningham  John Ericson  is making a big push for her hand in marriage  but she repeatedly rebuffs him  Ed is also the editor of the local newspaper  writing scathing articles about businessman Clint Stark  Arthur O Connell  who is trying to buy the town before the railroad comes  Of course  the townspeople have no idea about the railroad and Stark sees it as his chance to strike it rich  It is a town on the brink  facing a choice   whether to sell or not   and individuals trying to figure out what will make them happy  In Dr  Lao s arrival  he not only brings a circus but he brings them exactly what they needed  even if it was not what they thought they wanted  He brings joy  happiness  and clarity  alongside some harsh realities   courtesy of truth teller Apollonius  Randall    that force the audience to see themselves and their situations as they truly are with no filter The biggest assets for 7 Faces of Dr  Lao are two fold  its sense of wonder and Tony Randall  The latter may be occasionally acting as an Asian man and quite offensively so  but he brings his usual charm otherwise and genuine levity  Even as a deathly serious truth teller  Randall s persona shines through and contributes heavily to the film s appeal  For the most part  it is how believable he is as a man coming to town selling the impossible  dreams and imagination  There is a manic energy about him that helps it come to fruition  especially as he puts on the circus  The sense of wonder that 7 Faces of Dr  Lao traffics in is especially shown here in the circus and the aftermath with his  pet  daring the audience to believe in the impossible  After all  this is a man sent to help this town avert disaster by any means necessary  Suspending disbelief and forcing them to confront it via harsh truths  visions  and tricks are his methods of doing  taking the audience on a magical ride into a world where such a benevolent traveler is possible  George Pal is right at home making a film about the incredible and uses his experience here to the film s benefit  maintaining this magic all the way to the final beats Uplifting and hopeful  mixed with unfortunately dated and racist  7 Faces of Dr  Lao is a unique experience as a sort of cinematic fable  Tony Randall is great in the lead role  the effects impress  and the sense of wonder mixed with the great message consistently elevate the picture  It is impossible to fully wrestle it away from its transgressions racially  but if one s mileage is sufficient enough there  then the 7 Faces of Dr  Lao should prove a wonderful experience even if flawed ,3.5,Kevin Jones

9524,The Harmonists,1997, Even though they re obviously not my generation at all  not even my parents  or grandparents  I grew up listening to the music of the Comedian Harmonists  In fact  my mom has always owned the soundtrack to this film on CD and played it quite often when I was little  so when I watch the movie I know every single song  The film and its soundtrack came out the year before I was born  so there the generation thing fits perfectly The first time I watched this film was many years ago and I had forgotten a lot  but I remember that I loved it  And this time I felt exactly the same  Of course I m personally interested in this story  but I think even without that kind of connection it s just a very good movie  Comedian Harmonists is a biopic and history movie at the same time  because that band called Comedian Harmonists were active in Germany when the Nazis were rising  And half of the band were jews  so both stories didn t just happen at the same time  they re intrinsically tied to one another  I m interested in both  but I think the movie works just as well for people who are only interested in one of them  Actually I would recommend it to people who just want to see a different kind of movie about Nazi Germany  especially if they re also interested in music  The Nazi aspect gets explored on a very personal level and therefore it conveys the horrors of that time very well  The whole second half of the movie is simply heartbreaking My favorite sequence was the one in which the Comedian Harmonists went to New York  I ve never been to that city before  but I went to other places in the USA  so I have an idea of what it feels like to come to America for the first time  What I could relate to the most was when one of the band members said to the others  why don t we just stay here  after a few days in New York  That thought is something I also felt during my time in the USA  At home  living in America feels like a distant and maybe even unaccomplishable dream  but once you re there it suddenly becomes so real and tangible  and you just go  well  actually  why don t I just stay I m always impressed when actors cry in movies  and for some reason I m especially impressed when those actors are men  Maybe because it s something we don t get to see too often  sadly  I think I first realized that during my first watch of this movie  So it felt a bit special to me to watch its crying scene again many years later  even though I realized this time that it s not even that special compared to other crying scenes I ve seen in the meantime The band as well as the movie Comedian Harmonists mean a lot to me  but I don t think my rating is influenced by that  I genuinely think it s objectively a great movie  It s engaging and educational on a musical and historical level  and I m so glad it lived up to the expectations I had before my first watch and to the memories I had before this second watch ,4.5,Tiger LilyüêØüå∏

18860,Swordsman,1990, A highly influential wuxia that was originally a King Hu   project before producer Tsui Hark   apparently gave him the boot and finished the movie with a team of his filmmaker buddies  most notably Tony Ching and Ann Hui  For a movie with such a troubled production history  Swordsman is surprisingly solid  Very entertaining with a lot of stylized  kinetic action I m looking forward to the Ching directed sequel  which promises to be bonkers ,3.5,Lou (rhymes with wow!)
18860,Swordsman,1990, One of the 90s oddest action films  Taken by a sense of romantic tragedy and Tsui Hark Ching Siu Tung s hyper aggressive action style  KIng Hu is the credit director although how much of the movie he actually did direct before Tsui fired him is an open question  he certainly responsible for casting Sam Hui  an aging romantic heartthrob instead of a martial artist  in the lead which naturally moves the film far away from what one might expect from a HK action epic  Letterboxd lists all the other 5 directors more usually associated with directing parts of it but depending on who you ask even more people was involved  Yet  Swordsman doesn t feel incoherent from a scene to scene basis  just very peculiar  I suspect Hu was going for something very similar to what Ang Lee did with Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon before Tsui pushed it into pure kineticism  The sense of romantic longing and sacrifice survives intact  Ching Siu Tung action choreography pushing what he and Tsui did on A Chinese Ghost Story towards a more traditional wu xia scenario is remarkable and one of the most influential of the dacade  one of the rare cases a film action scenes can be said to have spawn an entire genre  Whatever else  few films can claim to bridge past and future quite so clear ,3.5,Filipe Furtado
18860,Swordsman,1990, Another lot of victims under the sword  We are all made of flesh and blood  Why do we make such a mess of our own world Man  this movie is a mess  A big  beautiful  crazy  fun mess  Despite the five directors  including the original King Hu   which is what brought me to this  but also the great Ann Hui    this is a Tsui Hark film through and through  There is very little Hu in the final product  Hark was another of the rotating directors and the lead producer and this has everything I love and everything I hate about a Hark film It s unnecessarily densely plotted  six writers  It features frenzied super hero powered fight sequences that are completely constructed in the editing  pieced together with short  often confusing cuts  creating occasionally brilliant  but more likely unreadable  action sludge  The lack of staging clarity in the combat sequences and the sheer relentlessness of the action caused me to often zone out  But then suddenly three dudes running down a road would get split in half vertically by a gust of wind emitted by the chop of an evil martial arts god s hand  or a woman with supernatural snake charming skills would start firing serpents out of her sleeves like an airplane gunner  and then I would be all the way back in it  That s the Hark touch Also  as can be the Hark way  this leans into some absolutely gorgeous art production  particularly once we arrive among the  highlander  people  whose clothes and culture are absolutely amazing to look at  and whose two female leaders are bad ass It s a big 16th century Chinese fable wuxia adventure  and it delivers on a lot of fronts There is even thematic joy to be had here  While many of the power hungry hunt  fight  and kill over the Sunflower Manual  China s most powerful martial arts scroll  they all  several times  mistake it for a scroll containing the musical score for a song about the meaninglessness of mankind s pursuits in the face of the great enigma of nature  then we get several montage music videos set to a performance of the song  And that  if I may hazard a guess  sounds a lot like something that would be in a King Hu movie ,4.0,Joshua Dysart
18860,Swordsman,1990, Beware of your teacher  he is not as righteous as he looks  Empty words of righteousness are pretexts for a game of power struggle First  a point of clarity  because this is something I was curious about going in  there are six directors listed on this film here on Letterboxd  and the film s own opening credits list King Hu as the director and Tsui Hark  Tony Ching  and Raymond Lee as  acting directors  I don t know the particulars behind the film s production  Filipe Furtado suggests that King Hu was originally directing the film as a Tsui Hark production before Hark fired him and took over  or about these distinctions in different types of director credits  but I can tell you that the film feels primarily like a Tsui Hark film  The story is set in the Ming Dynasty and revolves around individual resistance to the imperial oppression of the Eastern Depot eunuchs  so narratively we re definitely in King Hu territory  but the style is all Hark  and Tony Ching  to a lesser extent  Exaggerated  expressionistic camera angles  thick  misty atmosphere  evocative  monochromatic color schemes  quick  punchy edits  and mystical  superhuman powers  But most amusingly of all  partially because I have a bad brain and partially because I have an American centric perspective on film as much as I try to resist it  what Swordsman really reminded me of was Kung Fu Panda  Swordsman s inciting incident involves the theft of a sacred scroll  my subtitles called it  The Sacred Volume  although looking around online I ve found a few other translations  from the imperial library in the Forbidden City  The Emperor s spies want the scroll back  and our heroes want to recover the scroll from its new hiding place before the eunuchs can get their dickless hands on it  but the real arc of the narrative  like Kung Fu Panda  performs a gradual decentering of the scroll s importance  Everyone thinks the scroll will bring them enlightenment  but the real enlightenment was the friends we made along the way I wanted to safeguard my descendants from persecution by acquiring an invincible martial arts skill  I never expected to come to this 1990s   Tsui Hark   Hong Kong   ActionNon Western Westerns,3.0,ScreeningNotes

18860,Swordsman,1990, In Tsui Hark s King Hu s Swordsman  magical swordfighting is standard practice  And you know what  I m kind of on board with that style of effects driven fighting where gusts of winds can split people in half However  the continuity in editing during the action scenes was terrible  I know that it s a byproduct of practical effects  everything they can show  they show  the rest  they don t  but it still looks terrible unfortunately  Surely it can be filmed better  Maybe a less ambitious approach could have worked better so we could see more of the action Basically  the director  and editor  have got a poor sense of geography within the scenes Stunts   81 100   The stunts in this movie are well executed and flashy  the ultra exaggerated mega flips notwithstanding  Narrative   48 100   I don t think I was engaged at all in the story before like  the 40 minutes mark  Yeah  the beginning is all over the place Fight Choreography   75 100   I dig how stylish it is  but that s more like personal tastes in terms of how it looks on screen than really good fighting  AKA I liked it  you might not  Fantasy based Enjoyment   65 100   The more it went  the better it became  and by the end I thought it hit its stride very well  I like this kind of over the top fantasy  wuxia action drama epics  They re one of a kind movies that you can t find anywhere else  whether you like them or not Will definitely watch the 2 sequels one of these days ,3.0,Daxtreme
18860,Swordsman,1990, Swordsman is credited onscreen as being a King Hu film but in reality  he left the film or was fired  very early during the making of it  There s really no trace of any of King Hu usual elements of his film style anywhere in the film that I could see but I m guessing that Sam Hui being the main lead might have been his decision  It s really an odd choice and I think it s safe to guess that Hu was behind that decision as the latter sequels quickly rectify this casting choice  The film is quite messy in terms of narrative and action but it s a lovable mess for me  It s not really surprising since there were at least 7 people that were credited  or uncredited  as directors  What won me over were the musical segments in this film  Yes  not the action but the music is the best thing in here  That s the only reason why I stuck with this for close to 2 hours  I m not a fan of the cinematography and the heavy use of the blue tint  The editing and quick cuts of the fighting scenes  which was typical in the 90 s films by Tsui Hark and Tony Ching Siu Tung  is not really put to good use here  How can I hate a film where it has Wu Ma and Lam Ching Ying singing together I m probably not the only one who has ignored this film and part 3 and just watched the second film  It s time to change that Watched in Cantonese with English subtitles,3.0,Lorenzo

18860,Swordsman,1990,  English below    Swordsman  von 1990  der hierzulande auch als  Meister des Schwertes  ver ffentlicht wurde  ist ein actionreicher chinesischer Wuxia Film und der Auftakt einer Trilogie und ein wahrer Klassiker des Genre W hrend der Ming Dynastie in China wird die geheime Sonnenblumenschrift aus der k niglichen Bibliothek gestohlen  Ein Beamter  der das Gebiet  berwacht  beseitigt alle Zeugen des Diebstahls  Ein Tatverd chtiger wird schnell gefunden und sein Haus umstellt  aber darin befinden sich auch Ling Wu Chung und Ling San  Mitglieder der Hua Mountain Schwertkampfschule  die nun ebenfalls gejagt werden  Sie fliehen ins Miao Gebiet  wo ihnen als Han Chinesen ebenfalls Misstrauen entgegengebracht wird Ich kann mich noch gut erinnern  wie ich vor gut 25 30 Jahren als ca  13 j hriger Teenager total auf asiatische Kampfkunstfilme gestanden haben   besonders auf die mit Schwerter und durch die Luft fliegenden Protagonisten Swordsman geh rte  zusammen mit den ersten beiden A Chinese Ghost Story  zu meinen damaligen Lieblingsfilmen aus dem Genre Der Film  der 1990 ver ffentlicht wurde  geh rt zu den absoluten Klassiker der 90er Wuxia Filmen und hat auch heute noch einen ganz besonderen Charme Unter der eigentlichen Regie von Tsui Hark zeichnet er sich besonders durch gro artige Action  Schwert  und Kampfkunst aus Der Film zeigt jedoch nicht nur beeindruckende sowie ziemlich blutige Kampfszenen  sondern hat auch eine ganze Menge Romantik zu bieten  Der Soundtrack ist hier besonders eing ngig und sorgt f r die passende Stimmung Aus heutiger Sicht ist die Synchronisation zwar etwas cringe  mit anz glichen Phrasen ala  Holz vor der H tten  und  hnlichem  was jedoch auch ein wenig den Charme des Films ausmacht In der heutigen hochaufl senden Ausf hrung wirkt das Make Up und die angeklebten Haare und B rte zwar nicht mehr so gut  aber das tut dem Unterhaltungswert keinen Abbruch Eine kleine Schw che des Films ist das Ende  das sich ein wenig zieht  Hier k nnte der Film gut 20 Minuten k rzer sein  ohne dabei an Tiefe oder Unterhaltungswert einzub en Insgesamt ist Swordsman ein gro artiger Film  der besonders Fans des Wuxia Genres begeistern kann und der sich durch seine visuelle Sch nheit  seine faszinierenden Charaktere und seine packende Handlung auszeichnet  Der Film ist ein Muss f r jeden  der das Genre des historischen Abenteuerfilms und des Schwertkampfs genie t und bietet einen unvergesslichen Einblick in die Welt des asiatischen Kinos Wer Namen preist  der preist auch das Unheil und die Eitelkeit Swordsman  from 1990  released in Germany as  Meister des Schwertes  is an action packed Chinese wuxia film and the prelude to a trilogy and a true classic of the genre During the Ming Dynasty of China  the secret Sunflower Script is stolen from the royal library  An officer monitoring the area eliminates any witnesses to the theft  A suspect is quickly found and his house is surrounded  but Ling Wu Chung are also inside and Ling San  members of the Hua Mountain Swordsman School  who are now also being hunted down  They are fleeing to the Miao area  where  as Han Chinese  they are also viewed with suspicion I can still remember how 25 30 years ago  as a teenager  I was totally into Asian martial arts films   especially the protagonists with swords and flying through the air Swordsman was one of my favorite films of the genre at the time  along with the first two A Chinese Ghost Story The film  which was released in 1990  is one of the absolute classics of the 90s Wuxia films and still has a very special charm today Actually directed by Tsui Hark  it excels in great action  swordsmanship and martial arts However  the movie not only shows impressive and quite gory fight scenes  but also has a lot of romance to offer  The soundtrack here is particularly catchy and creates the right atmosphere From today s point of view  the synchronization is a bit cringe  with suggestive phrases ala wood in front of the huts and the like  but that also accounts for the film s charm a bit In today s high resolution version  the make up and the glued on hair and beards don t look as good anymore  but that doesn t detract from the entertainment value A small weakness of the film is the ending  which drags on a bit  Here the film could be a good 20 minutes shorter without losing any of its depth or entertainment value Overall  Swordsman is a great film that will delight fans of the wuxia genre in particular  and stands out for its visual beauty  intriguing characters  and gripping plot  A must see for anyone who enjoys the historical adventure and swordplay genres  the film offers an unforgettable glimpse into the world of Asian cinema Whoever praises names also praises mischief and vanity ,3.5,traab üéûÔ∏è

18860,Swordsman,1990, A highly influential wuxia that was originally a King Hu   project before producer Tsui Hark   apparently gave him the boot and finished the movie with a team of his filmmaker buddies  most notably Tony Ching and Ann Hui  For a movie with such a troubled production history  Swordsman is surprisingly solid  Very entertaining with a lot of stylized  kinetic action I m looking forward to the Ching directed sequel  which promises to be bonkers ,3.5,Lou (rhymes with wow!)
18860,Swordsman,1990, One of the 90s oddest action films  Taken by a sense of romantic tragedy and Tsui Hark Ching Siu Tung s hyper aggressive action style  KIng Hu is the credit director although how much of the movie he actually did direct before Tsui fired him is an open question  he certainly responsible for casting Sam Hui  an aging romantic heartthrob instead of a martial artist  in the lead which naturally moves the film far away from what one might expect from a HK action epic  Letterboxd lists all the other 5 directors more usually associated with directing parts of it but depending on who you ask even more people was involved  Yet  Swordsman doesn t feel incoherent from a scene to scene basis  just very peculiar  I suspect Hu was going for something very similar to what Ang Lee did with Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon before Tsui pushed it into pure kineticism  The sense of romantic longing and sacrifice survives intact  Ching Siu Tung action choreography pushing what he and Tsui did on A Chinese Ghost Story towards a more traditional wu xia scenario is remarkable and one of the most influential of the dacade  one of the rare cases a film action scenes can be said to have spawn an entire genre  Whatever else  few films can claim to bridge past and future quite so clear ,3.5,Filipe Furtado
18860,Swordsman,1990, Another lot of victims under the sword  We are all made of flesh and blood  Why do we make such a mess of our own world Man  this movie is a mess  A big  beautiful  crazy  fun mess  Despite the five directors  including the original King Hu   which is what brought me to this  but also the great Ann Hui    this is a Tsui Hark film through and through  There is very little Hu in the final product  Hark was another of the rotating directors and the lead producer and this has everything I love and everything I hate about a Hark film It s unnecessarily densely plotted  six writers  It features frenzied super hero powered fight sequences that are completely constructed in the editing  pieced together with short  often confusing cuts  creating occasionally brilliant  but more likely unreadable  action sludge  The lack of staging clarity in the combat sequences and the sheer relentlessness of the action caused me to often zone out  But then suddenly three dudes running down a road would get split in half vertically by a gust of wind emitted by the chop of an evil martial arts god s hand  or a woman with supernatural snake charming skills would start firing serpents out of her sleeves like an airplane gunner  and then I would be all the way back in it  That s the Hark touch Also  as can be the Hark way  this leans into some absolutely gorgeous art production  particularly once we arrive among the  highlander  people  whose clothes and culture are absolutely amazing to look at  and whose two female leaders are bad ass It s a big 16th century Chinese fable wuxia adventure  and it delivers on a lot of fronts There is even thematic joy to be had here  While many of the power hungry hunt  fight  and kill over the Sunflower Manual  China s most powerful martial arts scroll  they all  several times  mistake it for a scroll containing the musical score for a song about the meaninglessness of mankind s pursuits in the face of the great enigma of nature  then we get several montage music videos set to a performance of the song  And that  if I may hazard a guess  sounds a lot like something that would be in a King Hu movie ,4.0,Joshua Dysart
18860,Swordsman,1990, Beware of your teacher  he is not as righteous as he looks  Empty words of righteousness are pretexts for a game of power struggle First  a point of clarity  because this is something I was curious about going in  there are six directors listed on this film here on Letterboxd  and the film s own opening credits list King Hu as the director and Tsui Hark  Tony Ching  and Raymond Lee as  acting directors  I don t know the particulars behind the film s production  Filipe Furtado suggests that King Hu was originally directing the film as a Tsui Hark production before Hark fired him and took over  or about these distinctions in different types of director credits  but I can tell you that the film feels primarily like a Tsui Hark film  The story is set in the Ming Dynasty and revolves around individual resistance to the imperial oppression of the Eastern Depot eunuchs  so narratively we re definitely in King Hu territory  but the style is all Hark  and Tony Ching  to a lesser extent  Exaggerated  expressionistic camera angles  thick  misty atmosphere  evocative  monochromatic color schemes  quick  punchy edits  and mystical  superhuman powers  But most amusingly of all  partially because I have a bad brain and partially because I have an American centric perspective on film as much as I try to resist it  what Swordsman really reminded me of was Kung Fu Panda  Swordsman s inciting incident involves the theft of a sacred scroll  my subtitles called it  The Sacred Volume  although looking around online I ve found a few other translations  from the imperial library in the Forbidden City  The Emperor s spies want the scroll back  and our heroes want to recover the scroll from its new hiding place before the eunuchs can get their dickless hands on it  but the real arc of the narrative  like Kung Fu Panda  performs a gradual decentering of the scroll s importance  Everyone thinks the scroll will bring them enlightenment  but the real enlightenment was the friends we made along the way I wanted to safeguard my descendants from persecution by acquiring an invincible martial arts skill  I never expected to come to this 1990s   Tsui Hark   Hong Kong   ActionNon Western Westerns,3.0,ScreeningNotes

18860,Swordsman,1990, In Tsui Hark s King Hu s Swordsman  magical swordfighting is standard practice  And you know what  I m kind of on board with that style of effects driven fighting where gusts of winds can split people in half However  the continuity in editing during the action scenes was terrible  I know that it s a byproduct of practical effects  everything they can show  they show  the rest  they don t  but it still looks terrible unfortunately  Surely it can be filmed better  Maybe a less ambitious approach could have worked better so we could see more of the action Basically  the director  and editor  have got a poor sense of geography within the scenes Stunts   81 100   The stunts in this movie are well executed and flashy  the ultra exaggerated mega flips notwithstanding  Narrative   48 100   I don t think I was engaged at all in the story before like  the 40 minutes mark  Yeah  the beginning is all over the place Fight Choreography   75 100   I dig how stylish it is  but that s more like personal tastes in terms of how it looks on screen than really good fighting  AKA I liked it  you might not  Fantasy based Enjoyment   65 100   The more it went  the better it became  and by the end I thought it hit its stride very well  I like this kind of over the top fantasy  wuxia action drama epics  They re one of a kind movies that you can t find anywhere else  whether you like them or not Will definitely watch the 2 sequels one of these days ,3.0,Daxtreme
18860,Swordsman,1990, Swordsman is credited onscreen as being a King Hu film but in reality  he left the film or was fired  very early during the making of it  There s really no trace of any of King Hu usual elements of his film style anywhere in the film that I could see but I m guessing that Sam Hui being the main lead might have been his decision  It s really an odd choice and I think it s safe to guess that Hu was behind that decision as the latter sequels quickly rectify this casting choice  The film is quite messy in terms of narrative and action but it s a lovable mess for me  It s not really surprising since there were at least 7 people that were credited  or uncredited  as directors  What won me over were the musical segments in this film  Yes  not the action but the music is the best thing in here  That s the only reason why I stuck with this for close to 2 hours  I m not a fan of the cinematography and the heavy use of the blue tint  The editing and quick cuts of the fighting scenes  which was typical in the 90 s films by Tsui Hark and Tony Ching Siu Tung  is not really put to good use here  How can I hate a film where it has Wu Ma and Lam Ching Ying singing together I m probably not the only one who has ignored this film and part 3 and just watched the second film  It s time to change that Watched in Cantonese with English subtitles,3.0,Lorenzo

8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, The Unfaithful Wife  is a film so resolutely defiant in its coldness  it nearly freezes out the viewer entirely Claude Chabrol s 1969 work  unsuccessful in France but praised by critics  is a methodical thriller depicting the misdeeds of a husband who discovers his wife has begun an affair with another man The icy exchanges of doubt  as well as the cohesive play of mutually assured deceit  are reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock s  relationship  works such as  Suspicion  and  Notorious   Wife  though  for all its intellect  also bears some of Hitchcock s  The Paradine Case  in its frustrating refusal to grant so much as a glimpse into the reasonings of its characters  bad behaviours  Obsession itself must be answer enough In Hitchcock s lesser relationship films   Paradine  most notable  the lack of psychological comprehension translates often to narrative hysteria and sloppy plot  see also   Spellbound  Chabrol meets with the opposite result   Wife  is so stoic that it practically leaves its audience begging for even a minor mental breakdown  something  anything  to melt away this exterior of total frigidity Unfaithful  is not faulty for its cohesiveness  Instead  Chabrol has plotted out its crimes with such tact and logic  all a viewer can do is stare into its icy visage  and wait for it to crack  It  and Chabrol  never do ,3.5,theriverjordan

8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, Remade three times  one of them being the more famous Adrian Lyne s Unfaithful  2002  Chabrol tells the story about a bored wife who cheats on her husband  as indicated by the title  Her husband is suspicious and hires a Private Investigator to confirm his own thoughts and the whereabouts of his wife Yup  that s it Now this is the part where I convince you to watch the film 1  It was about bloody time that Chabrol  a renowned Hitchcock fan  made a thriller  His past projects were asphyxiating in terms of bleakness  so his style making a transition to a crime story with a creepy musical score  a femme fatale remnant and suspenseful sequences was maybe the most logical step  He casts St phane Audran once again  this time as the sophisticated and sexy wife with a killer look  vicious intentions  and yet with her facet of being a caring mother while she s in home 2  Mentioned already  Hitchcock s influence is here  It was present since Le Beau Serge  1958  Chabrol s dark tribute  As is the case of Hitchcock  the power of this thriller comes from its cinematograohic language  the impact of silences  the attention to detail  the slow sequences creating suspense  the tense conversations between characters  and the contrast between this macabre environment and the more benign domestic family life  This contrast is put to great effect through Chabrol s lens 3  I m 95  sure that Chabrol knew this was a very simple and common story  even by the 60s standards  So not only the execution had to justify its simplicity  but also the resolution  I ll stop here for the sake of the enjoyment of others Making thrillers is an art  just like any other genre  and this movie proves it  Whether the final result is to redefine the genre  or simply to replicate it with style and provide a great entertainment value  a good crime film is a good crime film I rest my case 83 100,4.0,Edgar Cochran ‚úùÔ∏è
8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, to the casual eye  it may seem a sweet and delectable bourgeois life  a two story house sitting on a large rural French estate with luxurious and pristine furniture  a perfect husband and a perfect son  all the hours spent on one s whims and fancies  what more could a wife ask for  but small spaces separate the husband and the wife on the sofa and the mattress  once the lights are out there is the nagging quiet of a wide eyed dysfunction  the side eye of disappointment  the wife is bored in a marriage almost sexless and synthetic as every material possession surrounding them underneath its blissful fa ade  and it only takes a hushed phone call and a few Parisian trips to deduce the husband is not the lover  after all  the title alone gives it away  but heightened by the threatening sounds of piano keys and violin strings  the suspense hovering between the psychological and physical burns like a gulp of whiskey down the throat until the glass has been emptied  then a violent blow from a burst of anger precipitates a crime neatened meticulously with regained composure  it s acerbic as alcohol  nerves become fragile as glass while Chabrol s The Unfaithful Wife isn t necessarily astonishing  it frighteningly thrills not only with its moral dilemmas or its eerie nonchalance but also the bloodshed of jealousy turned into a blood pact of complicity  even then  the investigators solve the missing puzzle piece of the crime without giving concrete answers to the how s  and what s left is the faraway recognition and understanding only people in relationships have as the camera pans  shrubs and foliage keep the two people apart like the germinating madness from their contaminated romance ,3.5,J

8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, All the acknowledged secrets left unsaid  Chabrol takes his admiration towards Hitchcock and shifts it to a familiar territory of an adultery thriller  conducting the exercice with his usual mise en sc ne of elaborate movement and changing frame values  always dynamic and elegant  The tension between the main couple is palpably disquieting  so well handled with the build up until the murder  and the film s equally fretful  perverse resolutions are also truly great ,4.0,Diogo Serafim
8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, Should be more accurately titled The Jealous Husband since we are more aware of Michel Bouquet s thought processes than those of his wife  the enigmatically beautiful presence of St phane Audran  Chabrol is often called the French Hitchcock and though La Femme Infid le isn t Hitchcockian in plot  it toys with its audience in ways that Hitch would recognise  And there is one moment that has been lifted straight from a Hitchcock classic to very amusing effect  It s a finely paced and observed drama of manners revolving around wife  lover and husband  I do love it when characters go to groovy 60s niteclubs  especially when they are bourgeois and middle aged  St phane though would look stunning in any niteclub  so she gets past the bouncers no problem  But that s all the plot you re going to get out of me  Cool  beguiling and very French ,4.0,Fint

8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, Would have loved if the film was more about the titular wife  rather than the husband  but there s something extremely interesting the film does with its little infidelity plot  which results in murder  Usually a plot like this would have the drama escalate  there would be blow ups and there would be big emotions as fighting is required as part of the story type s DNA  Surprisingly enough  not in here and it s so clear what that decision says about the setting and the characters The wife has her little affair and the husband looks up the other man and sets out to confront him  except he doesn t express anger  He lies to the man  claiming that he and his wife have an understanding  setting the other man s mind at ease  believing he doesn t have to experience an aggressive confrontation  This approach of well mannered calmness runs throughout the film and it s a sham  It s the rich pretending that they re better than everyone else because they can keep a cool face  because it doesn t matter that the husband puts forth a brave face as he fraternizes with the man who s cucking him  eventually he boils over and kills him anyways  The rest of the movie is then all about the man trying to get away with murder and he does  He goes back to his wife and without exchanging words she realizes what he s done and he stands behind him  The two never have a confrontation about the subject as she burns the other man s picture  erasing the man s existence out of her life  essentially going to back to normal with him  It s not a happy ending though because what is normal  It s what lead her to the other man  It s the dissatisfaction being the wife and the mother of a picture perfect family that lead her to have an affair  The two may be well mannered on the surface  but inside they re exactly just like the rest of us ,4.0,Tuomas
8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, The Unfaithful Wife  is a film so resolutely defiant in its coldness  it nearly freezes out the viewer entirely Claude Chabrol s 1969 work  unsuccessful in France but praised by critics  is a methodical thriller depicting the misdeeds of a husband who discovers his wife has begun an affair with another man The icy exchanges of doubt  as well as the cohesive play of mutually assured deceit  are reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock s  relationship  works such as  Suspicion  and  Notorious   Wife  though  for all its intellect  also bears some of Hitchcock s  The Paradine Case  in its frustrating refusal to grant so much as a glimpse into the reasonings of its characters  bad behaviours  Obsession itself must be answer enough In Hitchcock s lesser relationship films   Paradine  most notable  the lack of psychological comprehension translates often to narrative hysteria and sloppy plot  see also   Spellbound  Chabrol meets with the opposite result   Wife  is so stoic that it practically leaves its audience begging for even a minor mental breakdown  something  anything  to melt away this exterior of total frigidity Unfaithful  is not faulty for its cohesiveness  Instead  Chabrol has plotted out its crimes with such tact and logic  all a viewer can do is stare into its icy visage  and wait for it to crack  It  and Chabrol  never do ,3.5,theriverjordan
8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, Bourgeois surfaces are boring and uncivilized behavior is hot  in many ways the ideal Chabrol film   The violent gesture at its center and the eventual picture burning to cover it up  the only times action are actually taken  everything else remains repressed in that perfect realized image that the filmmaker sets and let crack  It is a movie Chabrol pulled many times  but usually never marry it to such tight expressed drama ,5.0,Filipe Furtado
8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, Remade three times  one of them being the more famous Adrian Lyne s Unfaithful  2002  Chabrol tells the story about a bored wife who cheats on her husband  as indicated by the title  Her husband is suspicious and hires a Private Investigator to confirm his own thoughts and the whereabouts of his wife Yup  that s it Now this is the part where I convince you to watch the film 1  It was about bloody time that Chabrol  a renowned Hitchcock fan  made a thriller  His past projects were asphyxiating in terms of bleakness  so his style making a transition to a crime story with a creepy musical score  a femme fatale remnant and suspenseful sequences was maybe the most logical step  He casts St phane Audran once again  this time as the sophisticated and sexy wife with a killer look  vicious intentions  and yet with her facet of being a caring mother while she s in home 2  Mentioned already  Hitchcock s influence is here  It was present since Le Beau Serge  1958  Chabrol s dark tribute  As is the case of Hitchcock  the power of this thriller comes from its cinematograohic language  the impact of silences  the attention to detail  the slow sequences creating suspense  the tense conversations between characters  and the contrast between this macabre environment and the more benign domestic family life  This contrast is put to great effect through Chabrol s lens 3  I m 95  sure that Chabrol knew this was a very simple and common story  even by the 60s standards  So not only the execution had to justify its simplicity  but also the resolution  I ll stop here for the sake of the enjoyment of others Making thrillers is an art  just like any other genre  and this movie proves it  Whether the final result is to redefine the genre  or simply to replicate it with style and provide a great entertainment value  a good crime film is a good crime film I rest my case 83 100,4.0,Edgar Cochran ‚úùÔ∏è
8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, to the casual eye  it may seem a sweet and delectable bourgeois life  a two story house sitting on a large rural French estate with luxurious and pristine furniture  a perfect husband and a perfect son  all the hours spent on one s whims and fancies  what more could a wife ask for  but small spaces separate the husband and the wife on the sofa and the mattress  once the lights are out there is the nagging quiet of a wide eyed dysfunction  the side eye of disappointment  the wife is bored in a marriage almost sexless and synthetic as every material possession surrounding them underneath its blissful fa ade  and it only takes a hushed phone call and a few Parisian trips to deduce the husband is not the lover  after all  the title alone gives it away  but heightened by the threatening sounds of piano keys and violin strings  the suspense hovering between the psychological and physical burns like a gulp of whiskey down the throat until the glass has been emptied  then a violent blow from a burst of anger precipitates a crime neatened meticulously with regained composure  it s acerbic as alcohol  nerves become fragile as glass while Chabrol s The Unfaithful Wife isn t necessarily astonishing  it frighteningly thrills not only with its moral dilemmas or its eerie nonchalance but also the bloodshed of jealousy turned into a blood pact of complicity  even then  the investigators solve the missing puzzle piece of the crime without giving concrete answers to the how s  and what s left is the faraway recognition and understanding only people in relationships have as the camera pans  shrubs and foliage keep the two people apart like the germinating madness from their contaminated romance ,3.5,J

8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, All the acknowledged secrets left unsaid  Chabrol takes his admiration towards Hitchcock and shifts it to a familiar territory of an adultery thriller  conducting the exercice with his usual mise en sc ne of elaborate movement and changing frame values  always dynamic and elegant  The tension between the main couple is palpably disquieting  so well handled with the build up until the murder  and the film s equally fretful  perverse resolutions are also truly great ,4.0,Diogo Serafim
8286,The Unfaithful Wife,1969, Should be more accurately titled The Jealous Husband since we are more aware of Michel Bouquet s thought processes than those of his wife  the enigmatically beautiful presence of St phane Audran  Chabrol is often called the French Hitchcock and though La Femme Infid le isn t Hitchcockian in plot  it toys with its audience in ways that Hitch would recognise  And there is one moment that has been lifted straight from a Hitchcock classic to very amusing effect  It s a finely paced and observed drama of manners revolving around wife  lover and husband  I do love it when characters go to groovy 60s niteclubs  especially when they are bourgeois and middle aged  St phane though would look stunning in any niteclub  so she gets past the bouncers no problem  But that s all the plot you re going to get out of me  Cool  beguiling and very French ,4.0,Fint

67612,"Black God, White Devil",1964, Arthouse Western  culturally unique and a scathing attack on the totalitarian powers of state  church and revolution In following a young married couples odyssey across the harsh Brazilian terrain they encounter the despots of its economic  political and religious spectrum  In doing so they too perform their own acts of evil imposed upon them out of necessity and complicity  The films states that in a land of cruelty and injustice the only places to turn to are violent and futile  It seems informed oddly by both French New Wave and Italian Neo Realism and although these two styles noticeably rub against the grain they are tempered by the strange and hypnotic music of Sergio Ricardo that acts as the people voice and occasional narration  Could benefit from being a little more narrative driven  like Bunuels films  as some of the arthouse tendencies are left me cringing ,3.5,Matthew LeCHARLTON
67612,"Black God, White Devil",1964, Wild West Summer 2021  week 18  Watch a Western that played in competition at Cannes  Venice or Berlinprogress  7 25You could say that Black God  White Devil was a film provoked by the impossibility of doing a truly great Western  as  for instance  John Ford could  Equally  there was a trail of inspiration from Eisenstein   and further ideas from Visconti and Rossellini  from Kurosawa and from Bu uel  It arose from this tussle between Ford and Eisenstein  from the anarchy of Bu uel  and from the savage strength of the lunacy of surrealism  Glauber RochaBlack God  White Devil fully embodies the pulsating energy  audacity  and idealism wrapped up in its director s description  full of handheld cameras  desolate landscapes  and women and men posed as heroes  all representing peoples and ideas bigger than themselves  It s impossible to watch the film and not feel the intensity of Rocha s passions   not only for film  but also for his country  and for the social and political change that he craved  In other words  it s an absolute masterpiece  but it s also one that can be challenging to digest This is particularly true because the figures to whom the peasants Manuel  Geraldo Del Rey  and Rosa  Yon  Magalh es  attach themselves   or  more accurately  to whom Manuel attaches both of them   don t seem to be advocating action that will address the problems of the people for whom they claim to speak  which makes Manuel very hard to understand  For example  both Saint Sebastian  Lidio Silva  and Corisco  Othon Bastos  are deeply selfish  the former working constantly to accrue more power and draw more people to himself  violently punishing those who resist  while the latter fights to  avenge my sorrow  and raids in search of wealth and women to rape  While they both exhibit well earned hostility to both the upper class and the power structure  neither appears to advocate any kind of significant systemic change at all  Indeed  Sebastian is firmly tied to the capitalist system  just one that s reversed  so that his followers are on top  and everyone else is on the bottom  While this would be a lovely respite  it s still just a temporary fix for a symptom  not a change so lasting that it will turn the land to sea  and the sea to land Similarly  while Corisco proclaims that he will  disrupt  order  until the land turns into the sea  and the sea into the land  it s very unclear how castrating a rich man and raping his bride destroys a system  Realistically  he s focused on getting revenge on a class that has looked down upon him   though he has been so conditioned by a life within their system that he condemns  Manuel  as  a cowherd s name  and summarily changes it  to Satan  of all things  Both of these demagogues seem mad in one way or another  Sebastian in his firm belief in his holiness  and the necessity of slaughter and arbitrary  physically challenging tasks assigned to followers  Manuel carrying the stone  for success  and Corisco with his wild vision of himself as a maker of change  even as virtually ever sentence he speaks starts with  I  and focuses on his feelings  and his death  and his plans Because of the glaring failings of Manuel s two heroes  it becomes almost impossible to sympathize with him  We can appreciate how lost he is  certainly  and feel sorrow for his rootlessness  but his actions and gullibility make him difficult to redeem  And  while Rosa shows more strength than her husband throughout their wandering  her sudden attraction to Corisco   both physically and emotionally  one assumes   is just utterly baffling  particularly given that it comes as his warped selfishness is truly manifesting itself As the film comes to a close  the single mindedness of both Corisco and Antonio das Mortes  Maur cio do Valle  the hired gun  is difficult to ignore  Though they view themselves as opposites  both seek redemption through their actions  and the line between their ideals and their emotions becomes so slim as to nearly disappear  The connection between the two of them speaks  perhaps  to the profound useless of the  solutions  offered by not only Corisco  but also Sebastian   they imagine themselves to be forces of transformation but  when it comes right down to it  they re just like the pawn of the system they set up their enemy ,4.0,sakana1
67612,"Black God, White Devil",1964, A startlingly original portrayal of the suffering of the oppressed  Black God  White Devil is a crucial film in the first phase of the Cinema Novo movement  Glauber Rocha s direction brings about the quietness of daily existence in all it s sweat dripping hardships for a people struggling just to survive  and early on focuses on the intense looking suffering in the eyes of its principal characters Manuel and his wife Rosa  played wonderfully by Geraldo Del Rey and Yon  Magalh es  The manual labours of the disadvantaged Manuel turn out to be the result of profiteering when his employer attempts to defraud him of his remunerations and commences to beat him  In a fleeting moment of anger  Manuel murders his employer and inevitably decamps with his wife and goes on the run into experiences which parabolically indicate anti authoritarian and political asseverations Many unique and stylised idiosyncrasies are employed along with reverences to Sergei Eisenstein as the film touches on Sebastianism  false prophets and a spectrum of other themes  many of which I m sure that I did not apprehend  The instances of incendiary violence  together with the shuddering handheld camera of cinematographer Waldemar Lima capturing people being dealt with inhumanely  has ample effectiveness that is initially misleading in their simplicity  The practical cacophony of the musical score by S rgio Ricardo creates a dramatic projection even when the camera is seemingly appreciating the scenic vistas of the topography of the landscape  In this film  religion exists as an exploitative device  and a further instrument to discriminate and regulate a people just endeavouring to find a location where they can settle peacefully ,4.5,Paul Elliott

67612,"Black God, White Devil",1964, Arthouse Western  culturally unique and a scathing attack on the totalitarian powers of state  church and revolution In following a young married couples odyssey across the harsh Brazilian terrain they encounter the despots of its economic  political and religious spectrum  In doing so they too perform their own acts of evil imposed upon them out of necessity and complicity  The films states that in a land of cruelty and injustice the only places to turn to are violent and futile  It seems informed oddly by both French New Wave and Italian Neo Realism and although these two styles noticeably rub against the grain they are tempered by the strange and hypnotic music of Sergio Ricardo that acts as the people voice and occasional narration  Could benefit from being a little more narrative driven  like Bunuels films  as some of the arthouse tendencies are left me cringing ,3.5,Matthew LeCHARLTON
67612,"Black God, White Devil",1964, Wild West Summer 2021  week 18  Watch a Western that played in competition at Cannes  Venice or Berlinprogress  7 25You could say that Black God  White Devil was a film provoked by the impossibility of doing a truly great Western  as  for instance  John Ford could  Equally  there was a trail of inspiration from Eisenstein   and further ideas from Visconti and Rossellini  from Kurosawa and from Bu uel  It arose from this tussle between Ford and Eisenstein  from the anarchy of Bu uel  and from the savage strength of the lunacy of surrealism  Glauber RochaBlack God  White Devil fully embodies the pulsating energy  audacity  and idealism wrapped up in its director s description  full of handheld cameras  desolate landscapes  and women and men posed as heroes  all representing peoples and ideas bigger than themselves  It s impossible to watch the film and not feel the intensity of Rocha s passions   not only for film  but also for his country  and for the social and political change that he craved  In other words  it s an absolute masterpiece  but it s also one that can be challenging to digest This is particularly true because the figures to whom the peasants Manuel  Geraldo Del Rey  and Rosa  Yon  Magalh es  attach themselves   or  more accurately  to whom Manuel attaches both of them   don t seem to be advocating action that will address the problems of the people for whom they claim to speak  which makes Manuel very hard to understand  For example  both Saint Sebastian  Lidio Silva  and Corisco  Othon Bastos  are deeply selfish  the former working constantly to accrue more power and draw more people to himself  violently punishing those who resist  while the latter fights to  avenge my sorrow  and raids in search of wealth and women to rape  While they both exhibit well earned hostility to both the upper class and the power structure  neither appears to advocate any kind of significant systemic change at all  Indeed  Sebastian is firmly tied to the capitalist system  just one that s reversed  so that his followers are on top  and everyone else is on the bottom  While this would be a lovely respite  it s still just a temporary fix for a symptom  not a change so lasting that it will turn the land to sea  and the sea to land Similarly  while Corisco proclaims that he will  disrupt  order  until the land turns into the sea  and the sea into the land  it s very unclear how castrating a rich man and raping his bride destroys a system  Realistically  he s focused on getting revenge on a class that has looked down upon him   though he has been so conditioned by a life within their system that he condemns  Manuel  as  a cowherd s name  and summarily changes it  to Satan  of all things  Both of these demagogues seem mad in one way or another  Sebastian in his firm belief in his holiness  and the necessity of slaughter and arbitrary  physically challenging tasks assigned to followers  Manuel carrying the stone  for success  and Corisco with his wild vision of himself as a maker of change  even as virtually ever sentence he speaks starts with  I  and focuses on his feelings  and his death  and his plans Because of the glaring failings of Manuel s two heroes  it becomes almost impossible to sympathize with him  We can appreciate how lost he is  certainly  and feel sorrow for his rootlessness  but his actions and gullibility make him difficult to redeem  And  while Rosa shows more strength than her husband throughout their wandering  her sudden attraction to Corisco   both physically and emotionally  one assumes   is just utterly baffling  particularly given that it comes as his warped selfishness is truly manifesting itself As the film comes to a close  the single mindedness of both Corisco and Antonio das Mortes  Maur cio do Valle  the hired gun  is difficult to ignore  Though they view themselves as opposites  both seek redemption through their actions  and the line between their ideals and their emotions becomes so slim as to nearly disappear  The connection between the two of them speaks  perhaps  to the profound useless of the  solutions  offered by not only Corisco  but also Sebastian   they imagine themselves to be forces of transformation but  when it comes right down to it  they re just like the pawn of the system they set up their enemy ,4.0,sakana1
67612,"Black God, White Devil",1964, A startlingly original portrayal of the suffering of the oppressed  Black God  White Devil is a crucial film in the first phase of the Cinema Novo movement  Glauber Rocha s direction brings about the quietness of daily existence in all it s sweat dripping hardships for a people struggling just to survive  and early on focuses on the intense looking suffering in the eyes of its principal characters Manuel and his wife Rosa  played wonderfully by Geraldo Del Rey and Yon  Magalh es  The manual labours of the disadvantaged Manuel turn out to be the result of profiteering when his employer attempts to defraud him of his remunerations and commences to beat him  In a fleeting moment of anger  Manuel murders his employer and inevitably decamps with his wife and goes on the run into experiences which parabolically indicate anti authoritarian and political asseverations Many unique and stylised idiosyncrasies are employed along with reverences to Sergei Eisenstein as the film touches on Sebastianism  false prophets and a spectrum of other themes  many of which I m sure that I did not apprehend  The instances of incendiary violence  together with the shuddering handheld camera of cinematographer Waldemar Lima capturing people being dealt with inhumanely  has ample effectiveness that is initially misleading in their simplicity  The practical cacophony of the musical score by S rgio Ricardo creates a dramatic projection even when the camera is seemingly appreciating the scenic vistas of the topography of the landscape  In this film  religion exists as an exploitative device  and a further instrument to discriminate and regulate a people just endeavouring to find a location where they can settle peacefully ,4.5,Paul Elliott

42449,Hearts and Minds,1974, We weren t on the wrong side  We were the wrong side An unflinching  infuriating polemic once you accept the fact that Hearts and Minds is a one sided affair with manipulative intent it becomes easier to discern Peter Davis  film with a critical eye  It s unquestionably a documentary that appeals to strong emotions rather than to intellect and uses filmmaking techniques to form an argument  but it never conceals its subjectivity and emerges as a truly awe inspiring piece of cinema where the images it presents speak for themselves and some light is shed onto this controversial period in US history This was certainly a brave film to make back in 1974  before the fall of Saigon and without the benefit of hindsight to provide clarity you can imagine the uproar it would have caused  It d be a stretch to call it balanced but it does give a platform to participants with both pro and anti war stances and we can draw our own opinions from what these people say  some of it is just as sickening as the Vietnam footage itself  which is often juxtaposed for ironic purposes  General Westmoreland s sickening fallacy  the Oriental doesn t put the same high price on life as does a Westerner  is then cut to scenes of the Vietnamese mourning lost family members it s blatant but so effective  It cuts deep  showing just how far reaching the consequences of war are for all involved and whilst not explicitly answering any questions  it certainly addresses them in a way that prompts discussion  Michael Moore cites it as a big inspiration and as far as documentaries go  there aren t many this intense Streamed on The Criterion Channel ,4.0,James

42449,Hearts and Minds,1974, The Oriental doesn t put the same high price on life as does the Westerner  Life is cheap in the Orient I am always wary of issue documentaries  that is to say documentaries that are more interested only in educating the audience  So I approached Hearts and Minds warily  fully expecting to be treated to a didactic sermon  What I found instead was a film of such power and vitality  that it is just as moving now as when it was created  forty years ago  Davis constructs the film in such a way that it plays as high tragedy rather than reportage Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the film is the sheer scale of the ignorance that is revealed about the American people  There are several heartbreaking scenes that contrast the views and opinions of prominent American officials with the reality on the ground  I led off with a quote from General William Westmoreland  commander of American troops in Vietnam  Immediately following his statement  the film cuts to a burial of a Vietnamese civilian  The man  killed by American action  has been placed in a coffin in the ground  The man s weeping mother tries to throw herself into the grave  with his corpse  but she is pulled out by other mourners  It is this kind of contrast that really brings home the message of Hearts and Minds At the same time  Davis draws out the similarities between the Vietnamese and the American people  The Vietnamese have fought an unending war for freedom  much like the American revolution  They fought the Chinese for 1200 years  the fought the French for a century  and now they fight the Americans  ever focused on finally obtaining their liberty  Before the beginning of American involvement in the war  Ho Chi Minh wrote to Washington  urging President Truman to aid Vietnam in its struggles against colonialist France  He saw so many parallels between his country and America  that he thought it impossible that America  having taken an interest  could do anything but support Vietnam in its struggle for independence  Source  The similarity between the two peoples makes the war between them all the more devastating In Hearts and Minds  Davis set out to answer three questions Q  Why did we enter the Vietnamese War A  Because of a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of the conflict  We thought we were fighting to contain Communism  and the Vietnamese thought they were fighting for their freedom Q  What did we do in Vietnam A  We killed vast numbers of Vietnamese people  many of them innocent citizens  Most of these killings were carried out in a dispassionate manner  but some showed excessive cruelty  American actions in general showed near complete disregard for the value of the life of a  gook Q  What did what we did do to us The final question is perhaps the most distressing  as the American people seem to have forced themselves into a sort of collective amnesia about Vietnam  We did our best to deny the lessons we should have learned  instead obstinately repeating the same old patriotic doggerel  And as a result  we have in some sense repeated the mistakes of the past  in Afghanistan and Iraq  without even having the grace to call them mistakes ,4.5,Will McGrew

42449,Hearts and Minds,1974, Hearts and Minds is the first fully fledged Vietnam war documentary that I ve seen  and it was one that had been on my mental watchlist for a while  I d heard various things about it  both negative and positive  mostly positive  and learning more about the Vietnam war is always interesting The documentary itself is very well made  with some brilliant juxtapositioning between official rhetoric on the war and the reality on the ground  This formula is effective and the director clearly knew it  It also makes for an emotive experience  which is always a plus in my book  For someone looking for a more holistic view of the war there are probably better options  but to be fair no 2 hour documentary would ever be able to properly cover it  Hearts and Minds does also raise some interesting questions on the roles of documentaries  Should they simply attempt to be an unbiased presentation of fact  with the aim of being as unbiased as possible and allowing the audience to decide for themselves on what they watch  or should they actively pursue a certain point of view  I can t be arsed to decide  but this one did everything well ,4.0,Louis
42449,Hearts and Minds,1974, First off  to clarify  I wasn t alive at this time so I really have no idea what I m talking about   I m about to make a lot of assumptions about the war in Vietnam and the climate in the United States at the time I have a feeling that the 70s  specifically around the time this film was released brought about a change in the the discussion about the war   I think the 60s were still about being a good American   Asking not what your country can do for you  but what you can do for your country   By the end of the conflict  that tune had changed   People started asking what our country was doing TO us   The anti war movement was already popular with liberals and youth  but I think the 70s brought about some revelations among the general public   This documentary does a great job of showing the other side of the story   A side that prior to 1974 probably hadn t been seen in such a professional capacity It s fairly one sided   So was the war   This just gives you a good look at the people involved   The actual humans that were forced by our government to fight and kill   It shows the lasting effects that war can have on a person and the physical damage it can cause   There is some really graphic stuff here  some stuff you ve probably seen before   It s sad   It s important   And I think the best documentary on Vietnam I ve seen ,4.5,sprizzle

44912,Green Lantern,2011, When it comes to superhero films  you ve got the underrated ones like  The First Avenger  GOTG2  TDK Rises  Batman Returns  and even Age of Ultron  On the other hand  you got the overrated ones like  Far From Home  Ragnarok  The Snyder Cut  and yes even The Dark Knight  In addition  there are the overhated ones too  like  Ang Lee s Hulk  the mcu s The Incredible Hulk  Iron Man 2  and even Thor  The Dark fucking WorldBut Green Lantern is legitimately THAT bad  It DESERVES all the criticisms it s been receiving  This film is the bane of my existence  I want to punish myself for even allowing the thought of acknowledging it slip through my mind  I seriously wanna know whoever the writers  dealer was because I need whatever they were on  My eyes were bawling out so much I could just grab them off my face  The last time I had this much cringe flow through my body was when watching a Dhar Mann video  and yet  I d still prefer a Dhar Mann video ,0.5,Arnonü™ê
44912,Green Lantern,2011, I know it s fun to hate on this movie  but I ll go out and say this isn t as bad as everyone says it is Maybe the Marvel fatigue has clouded my judgment  but in retrospect  it really is nice to see a classic superhero origin story with  for its time  good visual effects  a charismatic lead performance  we do not appreciate how solid of a casting Ryan Reynolds was as Hal Jordan  and really cool casting for the primary antagonist  Peter Sarsgaard is a fucking legend and he makes a bad role something pretty interesting Overall  this isn t shit  It s a very hollow and mindlessly entertaining B movie that actually has something fun to offer its audience ,3.0,Dakota Joaquin
44912,Green Lantern,2011, Here it is  the film that Warner Bros wanted to kickstart the DCEU  but instead became one of the biggest jokes in DC history that nobody respects  not Ryan Reynolds  not DC  even Teen Titans Go  doesn t respect it  and that say a lot This is one of the text book definitions of a cash grab  devoid of any creativity or originality  a fruitless attempt at a franchise  an adaptation of such a beloved character that failed on almost every conceivable level  and doesn t even get that stamp of so bad it s good as that implies that there s stuff to talk about Hal Jordan becomes one of the most blandest protagonist of any superhero movie  to the point that he could ve been any random straight white man off the side of the road and the plot of the film would remain exactly the same  unlike say a Batman or Iron Man film where only Bruce Wayne could ve been Batman and only Tony Stark could ve been Iron Man  This isn t a bias against Hal Jordan the comic character as he s my second favourite Green Lantern other than John Stewart  it s just they make him such an uninteresting character in this  even when he becomes Green Lantern he s just so bland The villain SUCKS  And is in easy contention for one of the most boring  lamest  most unthreatening supervillain of not just any DC film  but Superhero movies in general  I didn t remember a single thing about him  not his origin  his abilities or even his bloody name  I do have some respect for the writers for not taking the obvious route and making Sinestro the villain of the first film  but considering Mark Strong is such a good casting choice and he clearly tries his best with the writing  so if he got to show off more of his villainous side in this movie and given Mark more screen time to be evil  this might ve given the film a higher score There s no reason to watch this movie and just pray that DC will make a new Green Lantern movie with competent writers in the future  I m really sad that I didn t even find it funny bad  so I ve decided tomorrow I ll talk about the funniest DC film I m my opinion ,1.0,NoahGingerFox

44912,Green Lantern,2011, How can you make a film like this  see the finished product and feel proud of it  Is that possible  or do you think even those involved in Green Lantern were embarrassed when they witnessed what all of their hard work created For three years now I have heard countless people complain about Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan Green Lantern  After finally seeing this film  I don t understand why so much hatred is aimed towards him  Does he deserve any awards for his performance  Absolutely not  Was he the worst aspect of this extremely poor film  Not even close  Literally any actor on the planet could have been cast as the lead in this film and it still would have been terrible  Put this project in far more competent hands with Reynolds still playing Jordan and I m certain a pretty solid film could have come from it Oh  and what the fuck was with the special effects  I felt like I was watching an episode of that shitty show on TNT Falling Skies  I had to google the production budget on this film and somehow 200 million dollars was spent on this turd  How  Where did the money go  Did Tim Robbins demand a 188 million dollar paycheck for this I only watched this because my kid asked if we could  and she left the room after about 25 minutes  Smart kid ,1.0,Scott Anderson

44912,Green Lantern,2011, Everybody makes fun of how he s weak against the color yellow but much funnier in my view is that the bad guy in this looks like a Cthulhu monster made out of cat hairballs  But whatever the point isn t that this is dorky  it s that it doesn t lean in to the dorky stuff enough  It doesn t help matters that this was clearly cut to shreds in the attempt to make it seem cool ,2.5,matt lynch

35834,Eddie Macon's Run,1983, Viewed on Hollywood SuiteEddie Macon s Run  1983  is feature film released in cinemas in March 1983 but it seems like it was a Made For TV movie John Schneider stars as Eddie Macon  a fugitive from a Texan prison on his way to meet his wife and son in Mexico Schneider is mostly known for playing  Bo Duke  on the hit TV series The Dukes Of Hazzard  1979 1985 Kirk Douglas stars as Carl  Buster  Marzark  a corrections officer and former New Jersey cop  who is now on the hunt for Eddie Macon  to prove to himself he still has the goods when it comes to good old fashion police work Eddie Macon s Run  1983  features a boat load of notable actors playing side characters in this story  Tom Noonan  Manhunter  Mark Margolis  Breaking Bad  J T  Walsh  Sling Blade  and John Goodman in his first feature film Eddie Macon s Run  1983  is for Kirk Douglas enthusiasts and I guess HUGE fans of The Dukes Of Hazzard ,2.0,Nuno Costa
35834,Eddie Macon's Run,1983, To capitalise on his massive success on the small screen as Bo Duke in the hit  70 s 80 s TV show The Dukes Of Hazzard  actor country singer John Schneider was cast in this pleasant but very formulaic prison escape movie alongside screen legend Kirk Douglas who was no doubt bought on board to add a little Hollywood class to a very drab looking production which has the atmosphere of a made for TV movie Schneider enhanced his pay cheque by warbling a couple of very forgettable songs for the soundtrack and the awful score provided by Norton Buffalo and Mike Hinton just screams  1980 s  every time it s used  but despite these shortcomings   not to mention the hackneyed  clich ridden script   I still had a pretty good time watching it   at least right up until the very dumb ass ending which negates everything that has gone on before  why on earth after a dogged  no nonsense pursuit and capture of his prey would Kirk s previously unsentimental character suddenly decide   with no explanation whatsoever    to let Schneider off scot free with the throwaway line  I m getting too old for this shit Lame  lame  lame Still  director Jeff Kanew and Douglas must have enjoyed each other s company because they were reunited 3 years later alongside Kirky s old buddy Burt Lancaster for the enjoyable Tough Guys ,2.5,trolleyfreak
35834,Eddie Macon's Run,1983, Eddie Macon s Run was meant to make Dukes of Hazzard star John Schneider into a movie star  It was also from the director of Revenge of the Nerds and Gotcha  Neither of those things make it seem like Eddie Macon s Run will amount to much  but  well  you would be right  But at least things get off to a better than expected start before it starts rolling downhill Schneider is actually quite good as Eddie Macon  a poor southern sap who got an overly harsh sentence from a dickhead judge for punching his crooked boss  John Goodman  in his first on screen role  straight in the face  Macon is a family man  with a wife and ailing son  and after one ill fated escape attempt  he s facing a life sentence should he get caught again  Eddie thinks he s planned things well this time   escaping from the annual prison rodeo   and looking to link up with his wife and kid in Mexico   but hot on his tail is an aging  tenacious cop with a horrible unfortunate haircut  played by a very hammy Kirk Douglas Eddie Macon s Run initially employs a time shifting structure that s a lot more ambitious than most of the good ol  boy flicks of the era  There s also some genuine suspense in the early going  as Eddie learns that there are far more dangerous people to run afoul of in the south than the cops  It also looks pretty great throughout But towards the end of the second act  a wholly unnecessary twist arises that makes Eddie look like an enormous  oblivious  selfish jerk  It s not some new revelation about Eddie s past  but rather a complete lapse in character that makes no sense whatsoever  The last twenty minutes of this thing flat out sucks  with almost nothing redeeming  entertaining  exciting  or thoughtful about it  It s like the cast had an hour of a moderately decent movie and then were left to fend for themselves for the rest of it ,2.0,boredgrizzly

35834,Eddie Macon's Run,1983, Opened 40 years ago this weekend  Universal s EDDIE MACON S RUN was intended to be DUKES OF HAZZARD co star John Schneider s jump to the big screen  it was shot during Schneider s and Tom Wopat s contract dispute with CBS when Bo and Luke Duke were replaced for a stretch of episodes by Duke cousins Coy and Vance  but it didn t quite pan out  The movie flopped  though it went into heavy cable rotation for several years  Schneider and Wopat settled their differences with CBS and did DUKES for two more years  and Schneider s next movie was the low budget 1985  Argentina shot Roger Corman production COCAINE WARS  But the largely forgotten EDDIE MACON S RUN has aged well and has certain oddball aspects like a weird detour with a family of creepy cattle ranchers that in retrospect feel a little ahead of their time and would ve fit right in with a  90s indie thriller  Schneider is escaped con Eddie Macon  who improbably manages to make a clean getaway from a Texas prison with plans on running his way to Mexico  where his wife  Leah Ayres  has taken their son for treatments to battle a rare blood cancer  In hot pursuit is dogged  obsessed detective Carl Marzack  top billed Kirk Douglas  who nabbed Macon on his first escape after initially being locked up on some trumped up charges by some overzealous highway patrolmen and has a big scar above his eye as a constant reminder  Schneider may have been a charmer as Bo Duke  but he was never much of an actor  which is only more obvious in a movie where Douglas playing Marzack in the way he probably wanted to play Col  Trautman in FIRST BLOOD until he amicably left over script disagreements after a couple days on the set and was replaced by Richard Crenna is having a blast  Kirk even gets to grumble  I m gettin  too old for this shit  at one point  The packed supporting cast of familiar faces includes Lee Purcell  Tom Noonan  Jay O  Sanders  J C  Quinn  Gil Rogers  Mark Margolis  J T  Walsh and Dann Florek as a pair of sleazebags hitting on Mrs  Macon in a bar  and John Goodman getting the crap beat out of him as Eddie s asshole oil refinery boss  Writer director editor Jeff Kanew would next go on to 1984 s REVENGE OF THE NERDS and would reunite with Kirk on 1986 s TOUGH GUYS ,3.0,Mark Tinta

35834,Eddie Macon's Run,1983, Kopfjagd aka Eddie Macons Flucht Einer dieser Gef ngnisausbruchsfilme  in denen die Polizei grunds tzlich immer falsch liegt  Eddie Macon wird  bel mitgespielt und als er sich wehrt  wird er zu einer  bertriebenen Gef ngnisstrafe verurteilt  Das sieht er nicht ein und bricht aus  Kirk Douglas spielt den knallharten Bullen  der ihm auf den Fersen ist  Er ist auch im Grunde der einzige  den Eddies Flucht wirklich interessiert  weil er seines Schreibtisches  berdr ssig ist und es einfach nochmal wissen will  F r alle anderen scheint er wohl zu unwichtig zu sein  Die Verfolgung  die sich  ber verschiedene Etappen erstreckt  ist teils unterhaltsam  teils einfach nur haneb chen  Dass Kirk Douglas  der den ganzen Film  ber eine unnachgiebige Jagd veranstaltet  um sein Ziel zu erreichen  am Ende als g nnerhafter und verst ndnisvoller Kerl dahsteht  dem Eddie im Endeffekt noch dankbar sein muss und der anscheinend die ganze Zeit  ber gewusst hat  dass sein Handeln eigentlich falsch ist  finde ich ziemlich zynisch  An Eddies Stelle h tte ich ihm am Ende trotzdem nochmal eine ans andere Auge verpasst ,2.5,kultgestalt
35834,Eddie Macon's Run,1983, Opened 40 years ago this weekend  Universal s EDDIE MACON S RUN was intended to be DUKES OF HAZZARD co star John Schneider s jump to the big screen  it was shot during Schneider s and Tom Wopat s contract dispute with CBS when Bo and Luke Duke were replaced for a stretch of episodes by Duke cousins Coy and Vance  but it didn t quite pan out  The movie flopped  though it went into heavy cable rotation for several years  Schneider and Wopat settled their differences with CBS and did DUKES for two more years  and Schneider s next movie was the low budget 1985  Argentina shot Roger Corman production COCAINE WARS  But the largely forgotten EDDIE MACON S RUN has aged well and has certain oddball aspects like a weird detour with a family of creepy cattle ranchers that in retrospect feel a little ahead of their time and would ve fit right in with a  90s indie thriller  Schneider is escaped con Eddie Macon  who improbably manages to make a clean getaway from a Texas prison with plans on running his way to Mexico  where his wife  Leah Ayres  has taken their son for treatments to battle a rare blood cancer  In hot pursuit is dogged  obsessed detective Carl Marzack  top billed Kirk Douglas  who nabbed Macon on his first escape after initially being locked up on some trumped up charges by some overzealous highway patrolmen and has a big scar above his eye as a constant reminder  Schneider may have been a charmer as Bo Duke  but he was never much of an actor  which is only more obvious in a movie where Douglas playing Marzack in the way he probably wanted to play Col  Trautman in FIRST BLOOD until he amicably left over script disagreements after a couple days on the set and was replaced by Richard Crenna is having a blast  Kirk even gets to grumble  I m gettin  too old for this shit  at one point  The packed supporting cast of familiar faces includes Lee Purcell  Tom Noonan  Jay O  Sanders  J C  Quinn  Gil Rogers  Mark Margolis  J T  Walsh and Dann Florek as a pair of sleazebags hitting on Mrs  Macon in a bar  and John Goodman getting the crap beat out of him as Eddie s asshole oil refinery boss  Writer director editor Jeff Kanew would next go on to 1984 s REVENGE OF THE NERDS and would reunite with Kirk on 1986 s TOUGH GUYS ,3.0,Mark Tinta
35834,Eddie Macon's Run,1983, Just awful but Tom Noonan and John Goodman are never less than entertaining  But when the career parabolas of John Schneider and Kirk Douglas touch  you have to assume something has gone terribly terribly wrong  This movie is that ,1.5,Matthew Film Guy

109232,Katie Did It,1950, Cute small town romance with the always lovely Ann Blyth  Not the type of picture to revolutionize the rom com genre  but it s cozy ,2.5,PUNQ
109232,Katie Did It,1950, Most people remember Ann Blyth only for her dark and nasty performance as Veda  the selfish mean daughter to Joan Crawford in  Mildred Pierce  However  Blyth had a long career in film  more than 30  theater  radio and recording  She made musicals  comedies and more  Still  one mentions Ann Blyth and all that come out is  Mildred Pierce   Maybe some will remember  The Helen Morgan Story  in which she co starred with a young Paul Newman or  the Great Caruso  but few will remember or even be aware of a film like  Katie Did It  Released in 1951  the film is a charming light romantic comedy that today probably  after watching thousands of TV sit coms may seem stale or old hat  Adding to that feeling is the fact it was directed by Frederick DeCordova who soon moved into the world of television where he spent most of his career The film takes place in a small puritanical Massachusetts town called Wakely  It s so conservative Ted Cruz would be labeled a radical  Blyth is Katie  the town librarian with direct family links going back to the town s founders  But then  in Wakely  it seems that everyone has family history going back that far  Into town comes Peter Van Arden  Mark Stevens  a commercial artist from New York  While painting a new sign for a local store owner he meets the beautiful Katie  But our fair maiden is not interested in the city slicker  no matter how many overtures he makes  He even invites her to come to New York and scandalously pose for him  Obviously  she turns up her nose and refuses the offer However  when her uncle finds himself in debt for  500  Katie  an amateur songwriter  heads to the NYC where she believes she received an offer from a publishing house to publish her song  The publishers turn out to be bottom feeders who want her to pay them to publish her music  Not wanting to head back home without the money she goes to Peter s studio and reluctantly agrees to pose for one of his risqu  ads They of course fall in love over the five day period she is posing  that is  until Peter s sister in law and nephew come to visit and Katie mistakenly believes they are he wife and child  She heads back home to Wakely to marry the local dullard  Craig Stevens  her family wants her to marry only to be saved from this hell at the very last moment when Peter reappears  thanks to her rascal gambling uncle  and clears up the misunderstanding about his being married Katie Did It  is lightweight charm  For those only familiar with Ann Blyth in serious roles  you will be surprised to see her handle comedy so well  She can be both prim and stuffy saw as well as comically deft when required  It s no great lost work  but it makes for a pleasant viewing on a cold winter s night  I gave it an extra 1 2 star simply because I was charmed by Ms  Blyth s performance ,3.0,John Greco
109232,Katie Did It,1950, I always found Ann Blyth to be quite a sterile actress  She had the looks  but was always just a bit too aloof  That style of delivery is perfect for this story of librarian  Katie  who is all set for a rather humdrum marriage to  Stuart   Craig Stevens  until she encounters the live wire  Peter   Mark Stevens  who takes an instant shine to her  and who determines to break down her ice barrier  Much to her chagrin she  too  begins to find this initially irritating man quite charming  When she meets a young boy in his apartment  she gets the wrong end of the stick but can he convince her of her error before she walks down the aisle with another man  Stevens  her uncle  Nathaniel   Cecil Kellaway  and the young Jimmy Hunt  Steven  are on quite good form  but there is just too much dialogue and the pace of the story is really very slow  The ending is always pretty clear  too  It s an easy watch to let wash over you  with just a soup on of star quality from Blyth in her element   a sort of Jean Simmons light ,3.0,CinemaSerf
109232,Katie Did It,1950, Now smile I can t Well force yourself When her Uncle falls into grave gambling debt  a young woman has no choice but to model for for a manipulative voyeur  Hilarity ensues  Katie did it has a few laugh out loud moments  but unfortunately a lot of its overshadowed by the intense creepiness of the Male lead  Seriously  even by the standards of 1950s Rom coms this guy gives off big creeper vibes  I mean  at one point Pete convinces a train ticket inspector Katie is his mentally ill wife so he can physically restrain her and stop the poor girl from getting away from him Over all though  this unfortunate angle didn t rob us of a masterpiece  Whether it was at the time I can t say  but now it is certainly quite paint by numbers  I honestly can t recommend this one unless you re looking for something with hilariously creepy romance ,2.5,Charlie Dawson

30341,Villain,1971, I really cannot go on living with the knowledge that a Richard Burton gay sex scene was filmed and exists in the world but was left on the cutting room floor  and THEN for the blu ray restoration  the copy i watched  the beginning of it was left in only for it to fade to black abruptly before anything really happened  I literally can t put my feelings into words like I am distraught,4.5,Chris üçâ
30341,Villain,1971, Vic Dakin  You know  if I looked at one of them  they d piss in their pants  Because I m Vic Dakin  Bob Matthews  Used to be  Vic Dakin  And who are you  What do  you  do  Keeping Britain clean on thirty quid a week  Respect  Respect  You don t know what it is  Unless you re Vic Dakin  Tell  im  someone  tell  im  There is a scene during a blag where they really struggle to get their hands on the loot where a suitcase is stolen and tripods explode out of the side of the case  Never seen anything like that before it was a real WTF moment  Richard Burton is Vic Dakin dodgy cockney accent and all who is an all around nasty piece of work except he loves his mother and is obsessed with his boyfriend  Wolf  Ian McShane  hard to imagine this character wasn t inspired by Ronnie Kray  McShane is a hustler with his fingers in all the pies when he s not manipulating women into prostitution so he can blackmail politicians he s doing his best to avoid Vic  Unfortunately for Wolf that is next to impossible  he takes a beating or two from Vic who looks down on his hustling lifestyle as being  low rent Other notable names in this gangster flick are Colin Welland and Nigel Davenport playing the two main coppers trying to take down Vic  Del Henney  Straw Dogs  with some quite frankly impressive sideburns plays one of Vic s muscle  Tony Selby plays Duncan whose job seems to be to look after Vic s mum   supplying her with an endless amount of jellied eels or was it cockles  I forget  The best part of the film is the robbery the gang carefully plans and attempts to carry out  Of course  these things never go according to plan no matter how much lemon juice the bad guys have at hand to squeeze into the face of their targets  Shit goes south with the aforementioned anti robbery device thing and the robbery in general really becoming a struggle resulting in an all out fight and a fantastic car chase  Utter chaos ensues  A movie I have heard about for years just never been that easy to find so glad I got to tick this off the list at long last  Not that I want to compare it to another film of this era but considering the subject matter people will obviously compare it to GET CARTER  It s no Get Carter but what is  Still  a great gangster film from that era that is never spoken about enough   Despite the dodgy accent  Burton is great in this not sure I agree with the critics at the time who branded his performance  over the top  The version I watched DID NOT have the much talked about sex scene between Burton and McShane which was a tad disappointing  Burton did give up his usual  1 million dollar fee and instead opted for a percentage of the profits of the film  It was a huge flop so this ended up being the end of his days as a bankable star  It was amusing reading that Elizabeth Taylor used to come to the set every day as she did not trust Burton with all those young actresses  Which was probably a smart move ,4.5,BeardofTsu
30341,Villain,1971, Stupid punters   telly all week  screw the wife Saturdays By the late 1960s  a lot of critics were shaking their heads in dismay and writing the obits for Richard Burton s career  He was  to their mind  a great actor who had simply squandered his talent on unwise choices  An actor whose best known role was not as they had hoped  the Shakespearean greats  but was instead that of Mr Elizabeth Taylor in the ongoing  glitzy and gaudy pantomime of their marriage  They were Brangelina  they were Kim and Kanye  they were Posh and Becks  They were all those and more  the celebrity power couple before the term had even been coined and  in that less celeb crazed time  Burton being so high profile meant just one thing to the critics   wasted potential   But the critics were wrong  Granted  Burton made some truly horrible decisions from the late 1960s and up until his untimely death in 1984  there were roles in populist fare that kept him from treading the boards where they felt his talent thrived and yes  he often sleepwalked through some of these appearances  but he was far from washed up  Because when Burton felt the material was worth it  he gave it his all and when he did  he was capable of turning in a fine performance that positively crackled upon the screen  The role of gangland kingpin Vic Dakin here  is just such a performance   a role so meaty he could truly get his teeth into and enjoy it with absolute relish  When we talk of classic British gangster movies  we talk of Get Carter  which Villain came hot on the heels of  and The Long Good Friday  films which benefit from two truly iconic gangster characters in Michael Caine s enforcer Jack Carter and Bob Hoskins  mob boss Harold Shand  These are characters which can stand comfortably alongside the greats from Hollywood  the home of the traditional gangster genre  with Caine as chillingly cobra eyed as a Bogart or Raft  and Hoskins as snarlingly feral as Edward G Robinson  It s a shame therefore that Villain isn t as well known and as celebrated as these two films  because in Burton s Dakin we perhaps have our own James Cagney  Just look at that final speech he has here  it s right up there  Seriously  by the time the credits roll you won t care that Burton couldn t really do a cockney accent  He is Vic Dakin  and that demands your respect Dakin is a gloriously complex and creepy monster  obviously inspired by the Kray twins  who had been convicted of murder the year prior to filming  though with a particular emphasis on the certifiable Ronnie  When we first meet him he suggests a girl makes a cup of tea whilst he busies himself slashing her boyfriend s face off  his vicious nature also spares room for a sneering contempt for the ordinary nine to fivers of society  see the quote at the top of this review  but at the same time this taciturn tough is utterly devoted to his dear old mum  who he treats like a mixture of royalty and precious bone china  taking her down to Brighton every weekend  feeding her whelks and then   as Nigel Davenport s detective remarks   drives home at 30mph to ensure she doesn t get hiccups   Well he can t be all that bad   Colin Welland  his junior partner  memorably suggests on hearing this detail  As with all our cinematic gangsters Dakin makes a fatal mistake that sees his power snatched away from him  Receiving a tip off from one of the clients of his lucrative protection racket  Dakin and his firm try their hand at armed robbery  with disastrous consequences  But this overreaching error isn t borne of some ambitious desire to expand his empire  Dakin s folly stems from the fact that he is starting to feel his  middle  age  and fears he is seen to be going soft in the eyes of Ian McShane s young chancer  Wolf  And going soft is the last thing he wants when it comes to Wolf  because he s in the middle of a rather tempestuous love affair with this Ortonesque bisexual younger man  Burton claimed he had no trouble pretending he fancied McShane  indeed he said he found it rather easy because he reminded him of Elizabeth Taylor  I always get envious watching Ian McShane films from the  70s because Burton was spot on  he was such a handsome fella  I wish I could look like him back then  Gritty and atmospheric  Villain is wonderfully evocative of  70s London with its crisp location shooting and its fashions of flares  roll neck sweaters and sideburns  Those long gone London streets are populated by a great number of character actors and familiar faces that offer up an instant nostalgia hit to any British viewer of a certain age  and they deliver bluntly authentic dialogue  shocking in its day I presume  that came from the pen of no less a writing partnership than Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais  better known for their comedies such as The Likely Lads  Porridge and Auf Wiedersehen Pet   Directed by first timer Michael Tuchner  this is an acutely observed piece with a great sense of place and character  It s a shame that Tuchner s potential never seemed to be achieved after this   he crossed the pond and back a few times to produce a series of TV movies and low budget offerings  some of them over here being good  the Play for Today Bar Mitzvah Boy  and reuniting with Clement and La Frenais to make the big screen spin off of The Likely Lads in  76  but most of them over there seem decidedly humdrum  Hart to Hart revivals and several movies of the week  along with some you simply struggle to categorise  Mr Quilp   a musical adaptation of Dickens  The Old Curiosity Shop  and the Smith and Jones vehicle Wilt  He did make the big screen adaptation of Alistair MacLean s Fear is the Key the year after this though  and that s on my to watch list In conclusion  whilst Villain isn t the British crime drama that deserves immediate reappraisal  that is of course Peter Yates  brilliant Great Train Robbery inspired 1967 film Robbery  it is nonetheless worth your time for a truly interesting lead performance by Burton and some really authentic progressive moves in the crime genre  the homosexual gangster  his seedy connections to parliament  the decline of old fashioned crime and uncompromising dialogue  But the downside is that its narrative is just too small fry compared to Get Carter and The Long Good Friday and that is why ultimately it remains in the shadows ,3.5,Mark Cunliffe üáµüá∏
30341,Villain,1971, 1971 In Review   May 3A razor wielding London thug  Richard Burton  robs a payroll with his gang  his pimp boyfriend  Ian McShane  has the alibi Villain is a classic example of the English gangster genre which stretches from Brighton Rock  through Get Garter and the Long Good Friday  to Lock  Stock etc  Writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have fashioned a kind of East End version of White Heat with Burton in the mother fixated Jimmy Cagney role Burton gives us his Ronnie Kray impersonation and clearly relishes the sly dialogue of the script  The support includes notable turns from Nigel Davenport  Donald Sinden  and an hilarious Joss Ackland as a would be heavy with an upset tummy  The stand out though is a very young Ian McShane This has sadly seemed to have been lost to time which is a shame  admittedly it s no where near as good as the classics of the genre but is definitely worth watching for Richard Burtons performance alone ,3.5,Michael501 üì∫
30341,Villain,1971, The casting director of this film about East End gangsters was clearly telling a joke by having an Englishman  a Welshman and an Irishman as the top trio  The Englishman  Joss Ackland  gives a competent performance  knowing his accent won t be under scrutiny  The Irishman  T P McKenna  is given little to say so his ethnicity goes unobserved  The Welshman  Richard Burton  has such a mellifluous voice that the golden tones can t fail but break regularly through the Estuary  Luckily the chill in his eye and the air of don t you fucking dare that permeates his performance more than compensate for the lapses in Cockney Villain is an enjoyable if uninspired gangster tale with a bleeding edge of that new fangled early 70s nasty violence  It has salty dialogue courtesy of Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais  their sitcom roots showing through the witty banter between the bad boys  This type of banter would become an utter clich  over the decades but it must have seemed relatively fresh in 1971  Burton s gay  mother obsessed villain is a fascinating character  but his psychology is not probed deeply enough by the script  Ian McShane plays the rather reluctant apple of his eye  One joke about Burton choosing sweets because they re called Mixed Fruits is very 1971  But I forgive them since it actually made me chuckle Talking of mellifluous  or indeed fruity  tones  Donald Sinden gives a ripe performance as a sleazy and morally bent MP   plus ca change   while the female characters  with the exception of Cathleen Nesbitt as Burton s beloved Mum  are treated with disdain  But I never tire of seeing 1970s urban vistas   that grubby grime awakens something in me ,3.0,Fint
30341,Villain,1971, Richard Burton puts on his best gruff London accent as Vic Dakin  a Ronnie Kray  sans twin  type in this excellent  if seemingly forgotten  1971 British gangster film  A sort of gay  extended  very good episode of The Sweeney Really well written dialogue by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais  best known for TV comedy classics The Likely Lads  Porridge  amp  Auf Wiedersehen  Pet  and great acting from Burton  Ian McShane and a host of well known British character actors  This was cited as the start of the decline in Burton s career  but I think he s great   and far more cinematic than many of his overly theatrical performances in films It s maybe not quite as good as  and maybe overshadowed by  Get Carter released the same year  but still a great example of its genre I just wish they d left in the Burton McShane sex scene ,4.0,williamfaeleith

30341,Villain,1971, Richard Burton is a hard ass gangster  Sadistic  unforgivable  pure psycho  It s definitely a character study  A cold  hard one given the times  The beginning of the 70s  I guess everyone hardened during those times  Burton is putting down a crew for a fat robbery  Meanwhile the cops are snapping at his fanny  Brilliantly written and directed with fierce energy  This is a groundbreaker in terms of sex and violence  Trust me  A brutal masterpiece ,5.0,Waldo
30341,Villain,1971, 70s Crime MonthVic Dakin and his gang have a nice little wages job dropped into their laps   70 000 just begging to be snatched up while being delivered to a factory  It s about out of their normal line of business but it s a simple enough job Quite how he normally makes his living isn t clear  But what is clear is that if you double cross him or don t come up with the goods he s going to slice you up  if you re lucky Vic  Richard Burton  is a complicated chap  he s good to his dear old mum who he still lives with  taking her out for trips to the seaside and bringing her mugs of tea in bed  But on the other hand he s quick to punish those who incur his displeasure  even Wolf  Ian McShane  who as well as being affiliated to the gang also turns out to be Vic s lover  Which comes as a bit of a surprise to his girlfriend  who s so smitten with him that she doesn t mind being pimped out to the likes of Government minister Donald Sinden who later on is subjected to a bit of blackmail The robbery  doesn t go quite as planned  the victims put up a bit more of a fight than expected and in a scene which is echoed throughout the film  the use of excessive force is employed with great gusto as cars are rammed to the point of destruction and the men transporting the cash get the shit beaten out of them In short these guys do not fuck about and neither do the cops in the form of Nigel Davenport and Colin Welland who are quite happy to set up one of the gang in order to get their man and have no consideration or indeed concern for the possible consequences This is a cavalcade of leather jackets  driving gloves  flowing locks of shiny hair  mostly men s  and great early 70s British motors  OK  so maybe they aren t necessarily classics  but they are vastly superior to the shitty vehicles that factories in Birmingham were going to spew out in the next few years  Here were have Vic driving around in his Rover 3 5 Litre Coupe and Wolf s girlfriend has a Mk 1 Capri while the cops have to make do with an Escort  And of course no 70s robbery would be complete without a Jag  in this case an S Type which takes such battering that it has to undergo some ad hoc repairs before it can get on it s way as they escape the scene And of course all the crooks have to talk like they ve just stepped out of a Guy Ritchie movie  Except of course that actually everyone in a Guy Ritchie movie talks like they ve just stepped out of Villain It is clear to me now that Ritchie is not fit to lick the boots which Burton so readily and viciously puts into those who displease him  A classic of British Gangsterism ,4.0,Paul D
30341,Villain,1971, Villain is a nasty piece of work   Released the same year as the superior Get Carter  it demonstrates that the Brits were very willing to embrace the new freedoms regarding sex and  primarily  violence   Generally considered a minor UK crime film  it deserves more attention  mainly for Richard Burton s performance Vic Dakin  Burton  is a London crime boss who rules through intimidation   Everyone he comes into contact with is afraid of him  except for a police inspector  Nigel Davenport  and Vic s elderly mum  Cathleen Nesbitt  with whom he lives   Vic is a different breed of villain because he s gay   He seems to enjoy punching his lover  Wolfe Lissner  Ian McShane  both before and after bouts of sex    We see the slap but not the tickle   The bisexual Wolfe pimps his girlfriend  Venetia  Fiona Lewis  to get leverage with the influential  such as an MP  Donald Sinden  whom he will blackmail to try to protect Vic   Things begin to go wrong when Vic forces two noncombatants  Joss Ackland and T  P  McKenna  to take part in an elaborate robbery  with disastrous results   Vic thinks he s invincible  and it takes a while before he learns otherwise Villain is the most intense film written by the prolific team of Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais  whose credits usually involve lighter fare such as The Jokers and The Commitments   Their script displays an understanding of the complex hierarchy within criminal gangs and a feel for the way villains talk   The direction by first timer Michael Tuchner is serviceable  with the robbery sequence  well edited by Ralph Sheldon  standing out from the rest of the film  At the time of the release of Villain  I dreaded seeing McShane in anything because of his work in If It s Tuesday  It Must Be Belgium and Pussycat  Pussycat  I Love You  the latter being one of the worst films ever made   His Wolfe is sleazy and manipulative  but McShane keeps giving him hints of humanity and a sense of playfulness  which he would later exploit in Lovejoy  four of whose episodes were written by Clement and Le Frenais Nesbitt plays Burton s mother for the second time  following Staircase two years earlier   She seems elderly and fragile as Cary Grant s grandmother in An Affair to Remember but remarkably seems younger here 14 years later at 82   This is Nesbitt s first but not last brush with the vicious   She gives perhaps her best big screen performance as an unlikely drug addict four years later in French Connection II   Then there is Burton  who wasted much of his potential by appearing in mediocre  quick paycheck roles for much of his career  especially during the period following Villain  though I like his work in Exorcist II  The Heretic and The Medusa Touch   His Vic is notable even if it doesn t match his best work  Look Back in Anger  Becket  The Spy Who Came in from the Cold  Who s Afraid of Virginia Woolf   But it s a different performance than is usual for this great actor   Rather than rely as usual on his distinctive voice  he conveys Vic s thoughts primarily with his penetrating eyes   Note the wide range of emotions he silently displays as he looks at a witness who picks Vic out of a lineup  realizes Mum is dead  glares at the police presence at her funeral  dismisses Venetia when she invades his and Wolfe s love nest  and  finally  discovers his vulnerability at the end of the film   He s terrific  lifting Villain to a higher level   Random thoughts  Though Villain strives for realism  it fails miserably when a character is shot three times in the chest and stomach and falls forward   If Sam Peckinpah saw it  he probably fell on the floor laughing Tuchner worked mostly making forgettable TV movies   One exception is a surprisingly good The Hunchback of Notre Dame with a great cast  Anthony Hopkins  Lesley Ann Down  Derek Jacobi  David Suchet  John Gielgud Also see my review of Clement and Le Frenais  The Bank Job First seen  Auburn  AL   Also seen  TCM ,3.0,noir1946
30341,Villain,1971, You Ain t Seen Me  Right    The Summer Watchlist TrawlThe hoards of people interested in my review of a little seen British 1970s crime drama will no doubt be bloody shredded by the news that I can t remember much about this one as I watched it 4 days ago  Due to circumstances completely within my control  I haven t been able to review it until now  mainly because there s a lull in the Olympics But yeah  it was good this one  I m surprised it s so underseen actually because when I was younger I seem to remember this being spoken about a lot and getting reasonably regular outings on TV  Probably not the case these days  but that s a shame really because this is a bit better than merely a Krays aping London crime caper Richard Burton s versatility as an actor is something that has really only revealed itself to me in the last couple of years or so  during which time I have seen rather a lot of films with him in  Although his Cockney accent is alarmingly indeterminate  there s nothing to fault in the rest of his performance  especially when dealing with lover Ian McShane in a relationship that must have given the censors the screaming ab dabs back in 1971 Nigel Davenport s sarcastic but efficient cop is less cocksure and cynical than most you see in crime films from this time but it s a fine performance from an actor who  much like this film  is equally as under appreciated  Villain does have something of an American sheen to it and its finale is a bit dafter than it really had any need to be  but it s a very worthy film indeed ,3.5,üáµüá± Steve G üáµüá∏

30341,Villain,1971, Richard Burton puts on his best gruff London accent as Vic Dakin  a Ronnie Kray  sans twin  type in this excellent  if seemingly forgotten  1971 British gangster film  A sort of gay  extended  very good episode of The Sweeney Really well written dialogue by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais  best known for TV comedy classics The Likely Lads  Porridge  amp  Auf Wiedersehen  Pet  and great acting from Burton  Ian McShane and a host of well known British character actors  This was cited as the start of the decline in Burton s career  but I think he s great   and far more cinematic than many of his overly theatrical performances in films It s maybe not quite as good as  and maybe overshadowed by  Get Carter released the same year  but still a great example of its genre I just wish they d left in the Burton McShane sex scene ,4.0,williamfaeleith

30341,Villain,1971, Richard Burton is a hard ass gangster  Sadistic  unforgivable  pure psycho  It s definitely a character study  A cold  hard one given the times  The beginning of the 70s  I guess everyone hardened during those times  Burton is putting down a crew for a fat robbery  Meanwhile the cops are snapping at his fanny  Brilliantly written and directed with fierce energy  This is a groundbreaker in terms of sex and violence  Trust me  A brutal masterpiece ,5.0,Waldo
30341,Villain,1971, 70s Crime MonthVic Dakin and his gang have a nice little wages job dropped into their laps   70 000 just begging to be snatched up while being delivered to a factory  It s about out of their normal line of business but it s a simple enough job Quite how he normally makes his living isn t clear  But what is clear is that if you double cross him or don t come up with the goods he s going to slice you up  if you re lucky Vic  Richard Burton  is a complicated chap  he s good to his dear old mum who he still lives with  taking her out for trips to the seaside and bringing her mugs of tea in bed  But on the other hand he s quick to punish those who incur his displeasure  even Wolf  Ian McShane  who as well as being affiliated to the gang also turns out to be Vic s lover  Which comes as a bit of a surprise to his girlfriend  who s so smitten with him that she doesn t mind being pimped out to the likes of Government minister Donald Sinden who later on is subjected to a bit of blackmail The robbery  doesn t go quite as planned  the victims put up a bit more of a fight than expected and in a scene which is echoed throughout the film  the use of excessive force is employed with great gusto as cars are rammed to the point of destruction and the men transporting the cash get the shit beaten out of them In short these guys do not fuck about and neither do the cops in the form of Nigel Davenport and Colin Welland who are quite happy to set up one of the gang in order to get their man and have no consideration or indeed concern for the possible consequences This is a cavalcade of leather jackets  driving gloves  flowing locks of shiny hair  mostly men s  and great early 70s British motors  OK  so maybe they aren t necessarily classics  but they are vastly superior to the shitty vehicles that factories in Birmingham were going to spew out in the next few years  Here were have Vic driving around in his Rover 3 5 Litre Coupe and Wolf s girlfriend has a Mk 1 Capri while the cops have to make do with an Escort  And of course no 70s robbery would be complete without a Jag  in this case an S Type which takes such battering that it has to undergo some ad hoc repairs before it can get on it s way as they escape the scene And of course all the crooks have to talk like they ve just stepped out of a Guy Ritchie movie  Except of course that actually everyone in a Guy Ritchie movie talks like they ve just stepped out of Villain It is clear to me now that Ritchie is not fit to lick the boots which Burton so readily and viciously puts into those who displease him  A classic of British Gangsterism ,4.0,Paul D
30341,Villain,1971, Villain is a nasty piece of work   Released the same year as the superior Get Carter  it demonstrates that the Brits were very willing to embrace the new freedoms regarding sex and  primarily  violence   Generally considered a minor UK crime film  it deserves more attention  mainly for Richard Burton s performance Vic Dakin  Burton  is a London crime boss who rules through intimidation   Everyone he comes into contact with is afraid of him  except for a police inspector  Nigel Davenport  and Vic s elderly mum  Cathleen Nesbitt  with whom he lives   Vic is a different breed of villain because he s gay   He seems to enjoy punching his lover  Wolfe Lissner  Ian McShane  both before and after bouts of sex    We see the slap but not the tickle   The bisexual Wolfe pimps his girlfriend  Venetia  Fiona Lewis  to get leverage with the influential  such as an MP  Donald Sinden  whom he will blackmail to try to protect Vic   Things begin to go wrong when Vic forces two noncombatants  Joss Ackland and T  P  McKenna  to take part in an elaborate robbery  with disastrous results   Vic thinks he s invincible  and it takes a while before he learns otherwise Villain is the most intense film written by the prolific team of Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais  whose credits usually involve lighter fare such as The Jokers and The Commitments   Their script displays an understanding of the complex hierarchy within criminal gangs and a feel for the way villains talk   The direction by first timer Michael Tuchner is serviceable  with the robbery sequence  well edited by Ralph Sheldon  standing out from the rest of the film  At the time of the release of Villain  I dreaded seeing McShane in anything because of his work in If It s Tuesday  It Must Be Belgium and Pussycat  Pussycat  I Love You  the latter being one of the worst films ever made   His Wolfe is sleazy and manipulative  but McShane keeps giving him hints of humanity and a sense of playfulness  which he would later exploit in Lovejoy  four of whose episodes were written by Clement and Le Frenais Nesbitt plays Burton s mother for the second time  following Staircase two years earlier   She seems elderly and fragile as Cary Grant s grandmother in An Affair to Remember but remarkably seems younger here 14 years later at 82   This is Nesbitt s first but not last brush with the vicious   She gives perhaps her best big screen performance as an unlikely drug addict four years later in French Connection II   Then there is Burton  who wasted much of his potential by appearing in mediocre  quick paycheck roles for much of his career  especially during the period following Villain  though I like his work in Exorcist II  The Heretic and The Medusa Touch   His Vic is notable even if it doesn t match his best work  Look Back in Anger  Becket  The Spy Who Came in from the Cold  Who s Afraid of Virginia Woolf   But it s a different performance than is usual for this great actor   Rather than rely as usual on his distinctive voice  he conveys Vic s thoughts primarily with his penetrating eyes   Note the wide range of emotions he silently displays as he looks at a witness who picks Vic out of a lineup  realizes Mum is dead  glares at the police presence at her funeral  dismisses Venetia when she invades his and Wolfe s love nest  and  finally  discovers his vulnerability at the end of the film   He s terrific  lifting Villain to a higher level   Random thoughts  Though Villain strives for realism  it fails miserably when a character is shot three times in the chest and stomach and falls forward   If Sam Peckinpah saw it  he probably fell on the floor laughing Tuchner worked mostly making forgettable TV movies   One exception is a surprisingly good The Hunchback of Notre Dame with a great cast  Anthony Hopkins  Lesley Ann Down  Derek Jacobi  David Suchet  John Gielgud Also see my review of Clement and Le Frenais  The Bank Job First seen  Auburn  AL   Also seen  TCM ,3.0,noir1946
30341,Villain,1971, You Ain t Seen Me  Right    The Summer Watchlist TrawlThe hoards of people interested in my review of a little seen British 1970s crime drama will no doubt be bloody shredded by the news that I can t remember much about this one as I watched it 4 days ago  Due to circumstances completely within my control  I haven t been able to review it until now  mainly because there s a lull in the Olympics But yeah  it was good this one  I m surprised it s so underseen actually because when I was younger I seem to remember this being spoken about a lot and getting reasonably regular outings on TV  Probably not the case these days  but that s a shame really because this is a bit better than merely a Krays aping London crime caper Richard Burton s versatility as an actor is something that has really only revealed itself to me in the last couple of years or so  during which time I have seen rather a lot of films with him in  Although his Cockney accent is alarmingly indeterminate  there s nothing to fault in the rest of his performance  especially when dealing with lover Ian McShane in a relationship that must have given the censors the screaming ab dabs back in 1971 Nigel Davenport s sarcastic but efficient cop is less cocksure and cynical than most you see in crime films from this time but it s a fine performance from an actor who  much like this film  is equally as under appreciated  Villain does have something of an American sheen to it and its finale is a bit dafter than it really had any need to be  but it s a very worthy film indeed ,3.5,üáµüá± Steve G üáµüá∏

100592,The Hand,1965, The struggle for free will in a world ruled by a malevolent God  Relentlessly creative  impressively seamless and consistently captivating  The Hand is an early stop motion animation which would set the standard for everything that was to follow  Certainly not the first of its kind  but so far beyond everything that came before it that the only word for it is truly groundbreaking  It effortlessly overcomes the stillness that holds back so much stop motion by creating dynamic movement and utilizing experimental visual flourishes  the thought bubble and the nightmarish escape are particularly striking and inventive But not merely an experiment in film form  it s also a fascinating examination of the inherent antagonism between creator and creation  The Hand directs The Harlequin what to make out of his own clay  but the Harlequin disobeys and is eventually enslaved first by The Hand  then by his own self defeating paranoia Bids for control  The Hand over The Harlequin  The Harlequin over himself  are inescapably counter productive  Stop Motion Animation,4.0,ScreeningNotes
100592,The Hand,1965, Viewed with the Amazing Edith s Collab Film Group Objectively groundbreaking on an artistic level for its animation and technique involved  The Hand is a harrowing outlook on the lives oppressed by a totalitarian state  While the political messaging could not be more heavy handed  the execution is still thoroughly engrossing as Trnka imbues visual nuance and fluidity to his main character s every move Trnka was Czech  and this short film was  and still is  a brutal rejection of the communism that throttled his country  In this way  the film still very much acts as a warning to those who flirt with these ideologies that have been proven misguided and unsuccessful time and time again  The nice meta twist to this whole ordeal  and a bit of a Russian Nesting Doll thing going on  is that Trnka himself is controlling the harlequin as an oppressed entity through art  and that  the entire creative process is a relationship of a higher power willing things to be a very distinct way I have no idea if this was intended inspiration for the main antagonist in Super Smash Bros  as many others have mentioned  but regardless  this short film puts the relationship with our favorite video game characters and personal pieces of art into an entirely different light  boiling down the core messages of Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  nature vs nurture  playing God  creator vs creation  mob rule  as the harlequin resorts to every method in his arsenal to protect his little house plant  nature  The plant appears to be a therapeutic remedy for the harlequin since it is the part of his life not associated with his art and the oppressive hand  that demonstrate gradations of nurture  It does need to be said that most art does not directly interact with precious lives being tortured or hurt  so this read can be a long shot Through a political lens Trnka s messaging is clearly on point and succinct  In regard to the idea of creator vs creation  Trnka is clearly for freedom of expression to exist  I also agree  In connection to my possibly conflated assertion of Frankenstein  there is the further inclination to ponder over the unbound limits of creation and that  playing  God  whether attempting to break new ground for the sake of art or science or not  is a slippery slope that in itself is a microscopic example of totalitarianism  This is not me agreeing that art is equivalent to brutal forms of oppression  but that its potential to be equivalent  is a highly fascinating exercise to mull over in light of such a powerful short film  Thank you Mr  Broomer for this incredibly thought provoking experience P S  As I wrote my previous sentence I began to think of Jacques Rivette s La Belle Noisuse and the relationship occurring between the artist and their art  I never before took to this idea when reviewing that film via the lens of oppression  but it certainly adds some nice fluff to the conversation ,3.5,Ziglet_mir

100592,The Hand,1965, Ji  Trnka   1912   1969  was indisputably one of the greatest animated filmmakers  The brilliant puppet animation Ruka  aka The Hand  is the last film he made before his death in 1969 and reflects Trnka s own struggle to create art under a totalitarian regime  Made to take advantage of the post 1964 political thaw  The Hand was banned in the wake of the 1968 Soviet invasion  and no wonder  no amount of spin can dilute the moral force of Trnka s message   or his sly satire of mass popular culture  is it a coincidence that one of the hand s vehicles of totalitarian control is a television set Trnka directed some of the most acclaimed animated films ever made  In 1966  four years before his death  Newsday lauded him as  second to Chaplin as a film artist because his work inaugurated a new stage in a medium long dominated by Disney  Trnka  was a 1936 graduate of Prague s School of Arts and Crafts  In 1945 he set up an animation unit with several collaborators at the Prague film studio  they called the unit  Trick Brothers  Trnka specialized in puppet animation  a traditional Czech art form  of which he became the undisputed master  He also created animated cartoons  but it was his puppet animation that made him an internationally recognized artist and the winner of film festival awards at Venice and elsewhere  His films are brilliant  bizarre and meticulously rendered   Oddball Films   The Spectre of Fascism   Echoes from Totalitarianism  2016 Women Film Editors  209  Hana Walachov The impulse to make art can be as gentle as wanting to keep a flower in a little handcrafted pot alive I think what I admire most about The Hand is that Trnka tells his story without dialogue  it s both a specifically Czech parable and also universal  not requiring any language to express its protagonist s spirited efforts to maintain autonomy  individuality and dignity in a society bent on crushing free will  Wouldn t we all hope for tenacity in such an absurd scenario  Or maybe we all wonder what we d do in a situation both so comedic and so tragic   yearning to keep hope flourishing  just like that tender little blossom Ruka functions as an oppositional representation of political ideology and its limiting effects on human freedom  The short is a political allegory portrayed through a captivating animation style  which engages social representation and criticism through symbolism  In the figure of the harlequin  Trnka crafts a character through which he not only portrays himself as the artist  but any free thinking individual who gets robbed of their agency and induced into following and acting according to an ideology and regime  The animation short becomes a revolt against the political environment of Trnka s time  rendered evocative through the stop motion puppetry style  its subtleties and symbolic elements  which position stop motion animation as an effective of representation and protest against political oppression and power   Ren e Marie Pizzardi   Political oppression and resistance in Ji  Trnka s Ruka The Hand  1965  Fantasy Animation  2022 Women Film Editors  A Journey,5.0,theironcupcake

100592,The Hand,1965, The Hand is a Czechoslovakian short animated film directed by Jir  Trnka whom I am not familiar with at all but am now curious to learn find more  The story seems to be an allegory for the effects of a Totalitarian reign and the impact it can have on the common man  Here it is symbolized by a Hand of higher power restricting the way the puppet can live his life and he orders him to convert to the Hand s set of rules  Upon multiple refusals  the hand uses any means necessary to conform the puppet including bribery and threats  Trnka s animation is actually quite impressive in its simplicity and I believe that is due to the detail he put into the puppet s environment  This is actually a very somber and melancholy tale even though it starts off rather cheery but for all of these reasons alone  it is very much so an outstanding achievement in short filmmaking ,4.0,Robert Beksinski
100592,The Hand,1965, During the Communist era  the governments in East Central Europe tried to shoehorn art into the category of socialist realism  Artists were reconfigured as cultural workers who ideally created works to advance society in the same way that a steelworker shaped pig iron to advance skyscraper construction  The overlap was often quite direct    Stalin liked to describe writers as  engineers of the human soul  The same Stalinist definition applied to visual artists  who were supposed to enlighten the masses by reflecting back to them an idealized version of themselves and their society   x As is often the case with Collab films  I feel painfully ill equipped to write about something as important as Ji  Trnka s The Hand  Unquestionably a condemnation of the experience of artists under oppressive regimes  the film is a bold statement by a man in his mid 50s who refused to go underground as many of his contemporaries did under communism  Perhaps inspired by the canny resistance to Socialist Realism shown by the Czech literary community during the 1960s  something for which several of them were punished just a few years after this film was released  Trnka instead elected to share his plight and that of his nation with the world Trnka s presentation of the potter as a harlequin is fascinating  particularly because he seems to be a combination of a later version of the character   in his outfit   and an earlier one  in his chaotic insistence on working against the designs of the one who  in traditional harlequin language  is his master  Were his manner to match the era of his outfit  the potter would be mercurial  which is the last word that could be used to describe him Instead  the little potter is resolute in his beliefs  choosing without a second thought to maintain his independence rather than give into the will of the great hand  despite its power  authority  and apparent ability to provide the potter with anything he could ever want  Why  exactly  did the potter refuse  The lack of information here is both frustrating and freeing  Is he making a principled stand against any sort of authority  Does he have a history with the hand that left a bad taste in his mouth  Did he actually just say  Hey  lemme just finish this pot and I ll be right with you  only for the hand to be so pushy that the potter s stalling turned into a refusal so absolute that it cost him his life  In the absence of answers  we re left with the simplicity that Trnka presents on the screen  saying no is so obvious to the potter that it s hardly a choice at all Almost a mirror image of the choice the potter makes is the one made by the hand  It s made very clear from their first contact that  if it wanted to  the hand could  if not make the portrait itself  find someone else to do it as easily as just going next door  Rather than accept the potter s rejection  however  the hand turns the issue into a contest of wills  Very quickly  their confrontation ceases to be about the portrait and  instead  becomes one about absolute authority  and the force required to remind those under it just what  absolute  means And  when the potter is forced   literally   to accede to the hand s demands  it s a victory but  in many ways  a pyrrhic one  As many eastern bloc governments learned in the late 1960s and again in the early 1990s   and as the hand shows it understands by keeping the potter caged   bending a body to your will isn t the same thing as erasing the ideas in its head  The movements of the broken body don t reveal a belief in those movements  or even a respect of the authority that has been so viciously wielded  They reveal nothing more than an absence of choice  But the potter still has one option  and he takes it  tragically but triumphantly  defeating the hand even as it claims ownership over the potter s very death  This scene reminded me  odd as it may seem  of the end of 1974 s The Parallax View  when the system  without exerting itself at all  erases all of the resistance work that had been done by the main character and reinforces the status quo  It s not exactly an original idea  but it s one that made me wonder whether that film s writers  Lorenzo Semple Jr  and David Giler  were familiar with Trnka and his work Watched with the brilliant folks at the Collab ,,sakana1

100592,The Hand,1965, 1st Ji  Trnka  followed by Springman and the SS and The Devil s Mill As the inviability of our free market capitalist system becomes increasingly apparent  it is perhaps understandable that people turn to alternative models of political thought as potential saviours to the dire situation they see themselves in  One of those  of course  is the Socialist system  which most people see as finding its fullest expression in the Soviet Union  an institution that I ve seen people cheerfully defend  It maddens me that people could denounce Fascist governments and the actions of the US Government keeping children in cages and then in the same breath support a state that happily deported hundreds of thousands of people to work camps and psychiatric hospitals and tortured artists and intellectuals for their desire to critique a system that repressed individual thought  Sod a blacklist  imagine realising your family has been exiled or killed because of what you wrote  just ask Anna Akhmatova  Sorry  I m tired and in pain and I despise double standards with a passion  hence the unusually stirring nature of my prose But it is a legitimate rage to vent when considering the context of The Hand  The history of Soviet cinema is littered with individuals who were thwarted in their ambitions  the struggles that Eisenstein that got into could fill a whole book  Yet animation was a comparatively free medium  While Yuri Norstein s career was compromised by the taint of anti semitism inherent in the bureaucratic mess of MosFilm and The Glass Harmonica was Russia s only censored animated film  many directors were able to present more overtly abstract and confusing animations  including the riotous surrealism of Rein Raamat  because their work was seen as for children only  But Trnka s film was a rare outlier in this  a serious piece of animation that implicitly critiqued the Soviet Realist mode and its repressive desire to mould art into a celebration of the state  The titular Hand shows various images of itself as an object of power  Napoleon  a boxer  even possibly Stalin himself  It is an abstraction of power  a nightmare figure in a white glove that flexes its muscles to threaten our hero without ever explicitly attacking him  As a condemnation of a state apparatus that forces artists to submit through intimidation to create bombastic pieces of state supporting propaganda  it s damning through its sheer simplicity and force of metaphor  Yet it never feels patronising or hectoring  as some political art is wont to do I m so glad that I had to rewatch this with the chat  I really don t think i got it the first time around  and I wasn t aware of just how unique his puppetry style was in this film  The style of the Harlequin s face is radically stylised in comparison to some of his early films  with huge eyes giving him a soulful expression that makes his drama so much more powerful  The set of the little house seems incredibly unsettling now  including the wardrobe coffin that eventually entombs our forgotten hero  crushed by the strictures of the Hand and its desire for art to only be produced in its image  It combines to create a chilling testament to the dangers of repression of art towards a political goal  and a warning that artists serve a vital place as a critique to the self importance and vagaries of an overpowering state Ji  Trnka in Order 1  The Hand2  The Devil s Mill3  Springman and the SS,5.0,Dr. Ethan Lyon

100592,The Hand,1965, Viewed with the Amazing Edith s Collab Film Group Objectively groundbreaking on an artistic level for its animation and technique involved  The Hand is a harrowing outlook on the lives oppressed by a totalitarian state  While the political messaging could not be more heavy handed  the execution is still thoroughly engrossing as Trnka imbues visual nuance and fluidity to his main character s every move Trnka was Czech  and this short film was  and still is  a brutal rejection of the communism that throttled his country  In this way  the film still very much acts as a warning to those who flirt with these ideologies that have been proven misguided and unsuccessful time and time again  The nice meta twist to this whole ordeal  and a bit of a Russian Nesting Doll thing going on  is that Trnka himself is controlling the harlequin as an oppressed entity through art  and that  the entire creative process is a relationship of a higher power willing things to be a very distinct way I have no idea if this was intended inspiration for the main antagonist in Super Smash Bros  as many others have mentioned  but regardless  this short film puts the relationship with our favorite video game characters and personal pieces of art into an entirely different light  boiling down the core messages of Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  nature vs nurture  playing God  creator vs creation  mob rule  as the harlequin resorts to every method in his arsenal to protect his little house plant  nature  The plant appears to be a therapeutic remedy for the harlequin since it is the part of his life not associated with his art and the oppressive hand  that demonstrate gradations of nurture  It does need to be said that most art does not directly interact with precious lives being tortured or hurt  so this read can be a long shot Through a political lens Trnka s messaging is clearly on point and succinct  In regard to the idea of creator vs creation  Trnka is clearly for freedom of expression to exist  I also agree  In connection to my possibly conflated assertion of Frankenstein  there is the further inclination to ponder over the unbound limits of creation and that  playing  God  whether attempting to break new ground for the sake of art or science or not  is a slippery slope that in itself is a microscopic example of totalitarianism  This is not me agreeing that art is equivalent to brutal forms of oppression  but that its potential to be equivalent  is a highly fascinating exercise to mull over in light of such a powerful short film  Thank you Mr  Broomer for this incredibly thought provoking experience P S  As I wrote my previous sentence I began to think of Jacques Rivette s La Belle Noisuse and the relationship occurring between the artist and their art  I never before took to this idea when reviewing that film via the lens of oppression  but it certainly adds some nice fluff to the conversation ,3.5,Ziglet_mir

100592,The Hand,1965, Ji  Trnka   1912   1969  was indisputably one of the greatest animated filmmakers  The brilliant puppet animation Ruka  aka The Hand  is the last film he made before his death in 1969 and reflects Trnka s own struggle to create art under a totalitarian regime  Made to take advantage of the post 1964 political thaw  The Hand was banned in the wake of the 1968 Soviet invasion  and no wonder  no amount of spin can dilute the moral force of Trnka s message   or his sly satire of mass popular culture  is it a coincidence that one of the hand s vehicles of totalitarian control is a television set Trnka directed some of the most acclaimed animated films ever made  In 1966  four years before his death  Newsday lauded him as  second to Chaplin as a film artist because his work inaugurated a new stage in a medium long dominated by Disney  Trnka  was a 1936 graduate of Prague s School of Arts and Crafts  In 1945 he set up an animation unit with several collaborators at the Prague film studio  they called the unit  Trick Brothers  Trnka specialized in puppet animation  a traditional Czech art form  of which he became the undisputed master  He also created animated cartoons  but it was his puppet animation that made him an internationally recognized artist and the winner of film festival awards at Venice and elsewhere  His films are brilliant  bizarre and meticulously rendered   Oddball Films   The Spectre of Fascism   Echoes from Totalitarianism  2016 Women Film Editors  209  Hana Walachov The impulse to make art can be as gentle as wanting to keep a flower in a little handcrafted pot alive I think what I admire most about The Hand is that Trnka tells his story without dialogue  it s both a specifically Czech parable and also universal  not requiring any language to express its protagonist s spirited efforts to maintain autonomy  individuality and dignity in a society bent on crushing free will  Wouldn t we all hope for tenacity in such an absurd scenario  Or maybe we all wonder what we d do in a situation both so comedic and so tragic   yearning to keep hope flourishing  just like that tender little blossom Ruka functions as an oppositional representation of political ideology and its limiting effects on human freedom  The short is a political allegory portrayed through a captivating animation style  which engages social representation and criticism through symbolism  In the figure of the harlequin  Trnka crafts a character through which he not only portrays himself as the artist  but any free thinking individual who gets robbed of their agency and induced into following and acting according to an ideology and regime  The animation short becomes a revolt against the political environment of Trnka s time  rendered evocative through the stop motion puppetry style  its subtleties and symbolic elements  which position stop motion animation as an effective of representation and protest against political oppression and power   Ren e Marie Pizzardi   Political oppression and resistance in Ji  Trnka s Ruka The Hand  1965  Fantasy Animation  2022 Women Film Editors  A Journey,5.0,theironcupcake

100592,The Hand,1965, The Hand is a Czechoslovakian short animated film directed by Jir  Trnka whom I am not familiar with at all but am now curious to learn find more  The story seems to be an allegory for the effects of a Totalitarian reign and the impact it can have on the common man  Here it is symbolized by a Hand of higher power restricting the way the puppet can live his life and he orders him to convert to the Hand s set of rules  Upon multiple refusals  the hand uses any means necessary to conform the puppet including bribery and threats  Trnka s animation is actually quite impressive in its simplicity and I believe that is due to the detail he put into the puppet s environment  This is actually a very somber and melancholy tale even though it starts off rather cheery but for all of these reasons alone  it is very much so an outstanding achievement in short filmmaking ,4.0,Robert Beksinski
100592,The Hand,1965, During the Communist era  the governments in East Central Europe tried to shoehorn art into the category of socialist realism  Artists were reconfigured as cultural workers who ideally created works to advance society in the same way that a steelworker shaped pig iron to advance skyscraper construction  The overlap was often quite direct    Stalin liked to describe writers as  engineers of the human soul  The same Stalinist definition applied to visual artists  who were supposed to enlighten the masses by reflecting back to them an idealized version of themselves and their society   x As is often the case with Collab films  I feel painfully ill equipped to write about something as important as Ji  Trnka s The Hand  Unquestionably a condemnation of the experience of artists under oppressive regimes  the film is a bold statement by a man in his mid 50s who refused to go underground as many of his contemporaries did under communism  Perhaps inspired by the canny resistance to Socialist Realism shown by the Czech literary community during the 1960s  something for which several of them were punished just a few years after this film was released  Trnka instead elected to share his plight and that of his nation with the world Trnka s presentation of the potter as a harlequin is fascinating  particularly because he seems to be a combination of a later version of the character   in his outfit   and an earlier one  in his chaotic insistence on working against the designs of the one who  in traditional harlequin language  is his master  Were his manner to match the era of his outfit  the potter would be mercurial  which is the last word that could be used to describe him Instead  the little potter is resolute in his beliefs  choosing without a second thought to maintain his independence rather than give into the will of the great hand  despite its power  authority  and apparent ability to provide the potter with anything he could ever want  Why  exactly  did the potter refuse  The lack of information here is both frustrating and freeing  Is he making a principled stand against any sort of authority  Does he have a history with the hand that left a bad taste in his mouth  Did he actually just say  Hey  lemme just finish this pot and I ll be right with you  only for the hand to be so pushy that the potter s stalling turned into a refusal so absolute that it cost him his life  In the absence of answers  we re left with the simplicity that Trnka presents on the screen  saying no is so obvious to the potter that it s hardly a choice at all Almost a mirror image of the choice the potter makes is the one made by the hand  It s made very clear from their first contact that  if it wanted to  the hand could  if not make the portrait itself  find someone else to do it as easily as just going next door  Rather than accept the potter s rejection  however  the hand turns the issue into a contest of wills  Very quickly  their confrontation ceases to be about the portrait and  instead  becomes one about absolute authority  and the force required to remind those under it just what  absolute  means And  when the potter is forced   literally   to accede to the hand s demands  it s a victory but  in many ways  a pyrrhic one  As many eastern bloc governments learned in the late 1960s and again in the early 1990s   and as the hand shows it understands by keeping the potter caged   bending a body to your will isn t the same thing as erasing the ideas in its head  The movements of the broken body don t reveal a belief in those movements  or even a respect of the authority that has been so viciously wielded  They reveal nothing more than an absence of choice  But the potter still has one option  and he takes it  tragically but triumphantly  defeating the hand even as it claims ownership over the potter s very death  This scene reminded me  odd as it may seem  of the end of 1974 s The Parallax View  when the system  without exerting itself at all  erases all of the resistance work that had been done by the main character and reinforces the status quo  It s not exactly an original idea  but it s one that made me wonder whether that film s writers  Lorenzo Semple Jr  and David Giler  were familiar with Trnka and his work Watched with the brilliant folks at the Collab ,,sakana1
100592,The Hand,1965, I was offered a job last year to help forward the state s agenda  The job required me to employ tactics I found a bit on the thuggish side  I refused the contract several times  voicing my reservations with the manner in which the material was presented  but they persisted  They wooed me  they flattered me they lavished me with gifts I finally decided to throw a number at them so ludicrously inflated they d have to reject it Of course  they didn t reject it Today  I see people treating others in ways that disgust me  I see persecution  exclusion  and discrimination where compassion and understanding should be  I see families breaking up  friendships unravelling  and simple conversations erupting into violent confrontations over mandates we have been conditioned to view through a totalistic lens Absolutism abounds And for thirty silver pieces  I helped write that toxic narrative  well  at least I set the words to animated images  I helped people feel OK with bullying others into submission  I helped them believe it was their civic duty  I helped forge those attitudes into the prevailing default  It was such a distressing experience I publicly declared it would be my last Sorry  I don t mean to get political  This probably isn t the place for it  and it would crush me to think I ve offended anyone  but this is a film that calls me out on my shit  a film that stands up for independent expression  at a time when it was especially dangerous to do so  This is a film that inspires me to speak out and having said that  I ll shut up now Jeez  Life would be so much easier if someone would just pay me to make flowerpots I make really pretty flowerpots Watched with THE COLLAB ,5.0,Christian Ryan

100592,The Hand,1965, 1st Ji  Trnka  followed by Springman and the SS and The Devil s Mill As the inviability of our free market capitalist system becomes increasingly apparent  it is perhaps understandable that people turn to alternative models of political thought as potential saviours to the dire situation they see themselves in  One of those  of course  is the Socialist system  which most people see as finding its fullest expression in the Soviet Union  an institution that I ve seen people cheerfully defend  It maddens me that people could denounce Fascist governments and the actions of the US Government keeping children in cages and then in the same breath support a state that happily deported hundreds of thousands of people to work camps and psychiatric hospitals and tortured artists and intellectuals for their desire to critique a system that repressed individual thought  Sod a blacklist  imagine realising your family has been exiled or killed because of what you wrote  just ask Anna Akhmatova  Sorry  I m tired and in pain and I despise double standards with a passion  hence the unusually stirring nature of my prose But it is a legitimate rage to vent when considering the context of The Hand  The history of Soviet cinema is littered with individuals who were thwarted in their ambitions  the struggles that Eisenstein that got into could fill a whole book  Yet animation was a comparatively free medium  While Yuri Norstein s career was compromised by the taint of anti semitism inherent in the bureaucratic mess of MosFilm and The Glass Harmonica was Russia s only censored animated film  many directors were able to present more overtly abstract and confusing animations  including the riotous surrealism of Rein Raamat  because their work was seen as for children only  But Trnka s film was a rare outlier in this  a serious piece of animation that implicitly critiqued the Soviet Realist mode and its repressive desire to mould art into a celebration of the state  The titular Hand shows various images of itself as an object of power  Napoleon  a boxer  even possibly Stalin himself  It is an abstraction of power  a nightmare figure in a white glove that flexes its muscles to threaten our hero without ever explicitly attacking him  As a condemnation of a state apparatus that forces artists to submit through intimidation to create bombastic pieces of state supporting propaganda  it s damning through its sheer simplicity and force of metaphor  Yet it never feels patronising or hectoring  as some political art is wont to do I m so glad that I had to rewatch this with the chat  I really don t think i got it the first time around  and I wasn t aware of just how unique his puppetry style was in this film  The style of the Harlequin s face is radically stylised in comparison to some of his early films  with huge eyes giving him a soulful expression that makes his drama so much more powerful  The set of the little house seems incredibly unsettling now  including the wardrobe coffin that eventually entombs our forgotten hero  crushed by the strictures of the Hand and its desire for art to only be produced in its image  It combines to create a chilling testament to the dangers of repression of art towards a political goal  and a warning that artists serve a vital place as a critique to the self importance and vagaries of an overpowering state Ji  Trnka in Order 1  The Hand2  The Devil s Mill3  Springman and the SS,5.0,Dr. Ethan Lyon

72648,Devil Times Five,1974, The font for the opening credits couldn t be more of its time  bold  curlicued yellow lettering  Together with the wintry vibes emanating from the snowbound vistas of the San Bernardino National Forest area  it puts you in the mood for a cosy 70s slasher  The start is benign enough   a couple jovially preparing to go on a business vacation to a remote lodge   but you re immediately thrown for a loop by the fact these scenes are intercut with a mini bus careening off the road and tumbling down a hillside onto its side  A group of kids slowly emerge from the wreckage and as they begin trekking through the snow it becomes clear their destination will coincide with the couple s   an opulent house in the woods belonging to the seemingly notorious Papa Doc There s something off with these kids though  Instead of being shaken by the accident  we see one of their number casually pillaging items from the dead adult bodies in the overturned bus  Our suspicions are soon confirmed when we discover the bus was from some kind of school for mentally disturbed kids  Sure enough  what we have here is a cr che of mini homicidal maniacs  After Papa Doc and his assembled guests take pity on them and offer them refuge  what ensues is a gradual herd cull  The adults are too wrapped up in their own petty concerns to realize the danger they ve placed themselves in by inviting these kids into their home and it takes almost all of them to be picked off before it finally dawns on the remaining few who it is that poses the threat  What a bunch of morons This a weird film  Tonally  it doesn t really hang together  Far too much of it plays out like some  largely sexless and not especially funny  sex comedy  quite light  with a lot of inconsequential melodrama  The kids  despite their actions  are never in the slightest bit menacing   the one dressed in military fatigues even has his own jaunty little theme tune every time he appears on screen  Director Sean MacGregor makes some very strange decisions for the first kill  It inexplicably transitions from colour into sepia tones and is shot in super slo mo  dragging on for what feels like minutes  sapping all the life and danger out of it  By the end  it s like you ve awoken from a dream  with a vague memory of a murder having taken place  All the kills incorporate slo mo  which if not as excruciatingly drawn out as the first  don t help to ratchet up the fear factor either  The film also has a habit of throwing in freeze frames for no apparent reason  which just comes off as shonky editing  A word for the bath tub piranha kill though   that was pretty gnarly  Could have done with more like that The kids not being at all convincing as mentally deranged hellspawn I put that down to the fact they just aren t very good actors and have difficulty playing something other than what they are  which is a bunch of normal kids  The adults don t fare a lot better  from Papa Doc s scenery chewing irascibility to Lovely s horny airhead and the obligatory slow  slightly weird but well meaning handyman  Ralph It kind of held my interest  mainly to see these little bastards get their much deserved comeuppance but sadly that never happens  They basically butcher an entire household because it amuses them  I guess the original title Peopletoys is quite accurate in that respect  Really though  it just beggars belief that grown assed men of Rick and Papa Doc s stature wouldn t be able to handle this paltry collection of fun size bedlamites  Given  The Beginning  caption at the end  you could imagine sequels charting their growth into a Manson Family esque unit but I wouldn t have much interest in watching them and I can t imagine revisiting this origin story any time soon  Not a total write off   it has its moments   but on the whole  relatively bloodless  tame  tonally awkward and inconsistently paced ,2.5,WraithApe

72648,Devil Times Five,1974, The Horror of Marna Larsen presents  Horror ClassicsHad to watch this on YT as unfortunately  my MEDIA VHS copy had unspooled or respooled  rather  Up into the tape  And has to be taken apart to have the tape reattached somewhere  Originally from Carrs  or what is more likely  the grocery store that was there before Carrs  now Safeway  which is actually Albertsons  Market Place  Market place had free cookie day and I got to ride up front in the cart which would have been a lot more fun if my mom ran up and down the aisles but she never did no matter how many times I suggested it  My terrible segue being  who knows even what children are thinking half the time  Grown ups are just people who are there to push the cart and insist on doing it in the most boring way imaginable Then you get to be their age and you barely have the energy to get through the shopping and there are like fifty people who are mad at you for reminding them there is still a plague and there still aren t any Saltines which honestly some days  I would rather eat even over cookies  I may have wandered away from the point at bit there The kids are just so gosh darn cute  kinda like the scrappy cast of Annie and really  is there much difference between an orphanage and a state run institution  I also really love the chalet attic space play room a lot and wish it were mine  Maybe someday  I am trying to do something with the house  The other plan is I sell everything and we move to Japan  But running away is never the solution  Except that sometimes it is  Like when mentally disturbed children are trying to force you to play with them or mentally disturbed believers in sky people are trying to force you to have children even if you are only going to dump them at an orphanage or state run institution once they are born This is the way our sky father wants things But I am just an empty unperson who doesn t care about anything except  I do know I want custom shelves that are just deep enough to hold a single VHS tape so I don t have to double them up  one row in front of the other  like I do with my shitty Walmart shelves   I would also like the shelves to be lined with something really ugly such as shag carpeting or contact paper in a brown and yellow floral pattern on a pink gingham background  Or maybe ducks  I like ducks  Market place also had a seaman mascot  Seaman There ya go I still prefer Peopletoys and look  I found a way to say that at least once during this review as well  Now I have said seaman and peopletoys  My work here is done  Good night ,5.0,Marna Larsen
72648,Devil Times Five,1974, Isolated cabin in the snowy wilderness  A clawless catfight between two ladies rocking bathrobs  Lots of unintentionally hilarious interactions with the murdery kids and the snobby  constantly bickering adults  Some decent bloodshed  A promiscuous woman named Lovely  Four sociopathic lil demons aka kids killing everyone  A murderous teenage nun that aides the kids  A slow motion death scene that seems to go on forever  A really cool death by piranhas scene  One helluva demented ending Mean spirited 70s wtfuckery at its best wrapped up in an extra cheesy killer kids shell  One of the more underrated killer kids movies imho,4.5,Zay
72648,Devil Times Five,1974, I recently watched Peopletoys  aka Devil Times Five  1974  on Shudder  The storyline follows a group of kids who escape their group home and do whatever they need to survive  An unwitting couple decides to help them one day  and they ll quickly wish they hadn t Directed by Sean MacGregor  November Children  and starring Sorrell Booke  Boss Hogg in Dukes of Hazzard  Leif Garrett  The Outsiders  Gene Evans  Ace in the Hole  and Taylor Lacher  Mr  Majestyk While this movie has all the ingredients for a gem  it lacks a worthwhile special effects team to elevate the content   The characters and circumstances are unique  with a dark cloud hanging over the kids in every scene  They re sinister  effectively setting up worthwhile kill scenes  Unfortunately  the kills are lackluster and diminish what should have been great moments  Despite this  the plot surpasses expectations  featuring a nice twist at the end  along with some unexpectedly well shot scenes In conclusion  Peopletoys feels like a less well executed Children of the Corn   I would score it a 5 5 10 and recommend seeing it once ,3.0,Kevin_Robbins

72648,Devil Times Five,1974, Here are some types of movies I like 1  Movies where an assemblage of irredeemable assholes go on a weekend retreat together and bicker constantly while being murdered 2  Movies where the members of a group of oddballs are each defined by a single eccentricity that will figure heavily into the plot 3  Movies where a heavy snowfall complicates everydamnthing 4  Movies where weird kids murder jerks This movie is all of those kinds of movie And it has Sorrell Burke as a hapless doctor and Shelly Morrison as his alcoholic wife  And a bunch of pretty inventive kill scenes  And Leif Garrett establishing a homicidal Dennis the Menace Mr  Wilson relationship with Boss Hogg  And a truly haunting performance by Gail Smale as a murderous teenage nun fangirl  And Leif Garrett s sister and mother sharing a scene that would give Oedipus pause So  yeah  there s a lot about this movie that s way problematic  and that s just on camera  Even with the obvious stand in shots  these child actors are regularly put in situations in which child actors probably oughtn t be put  There are some poorly aged notions about gender fluidity  and the  wacky  score is one of the worst I ve heard  And of course  rumors of the director s off screen relationship with the aforementioned Ms  Smale put quite a pallor on the whole proceeding  Taken purely at face value  though  this is spiteful  ugly  and wholly entertaining  Leif Garrett scornfully calling Sorrell Burke  Harvey Beckman  over and over is worth the price of admission on its own ,4.0,Ira Brooker

72648,Devil Times Five,1974, One of those movies where I remember someone reviewing it here  but didn t even remember what it was about  This helped a lot since many of the twists and turns were quite surprising  I don t know how much of a spoiler this is  but I was not expecting this to turn into an evil child movie If you think about what makes a good movie  then the movie is bad  As a whole and in terms of the performances  I would describe that film as  shlocky  Not to mention one of the deaths has one of the most horrible uses of slow motion I ve ever seen  The reason I give this film such a relative high rating all things considered is that there are many other deaths and that the ending is so surreal and macabre  One of the few movies about sinister children that I have seen in which I feel that these children are truly perverse  mainly because of the actions they perform All in all  even though it s not the greatest horror film I ve seen  I would recommend it to fans of the genre TODAY SCHEDULEThe JacketDevil Five TimesInterstellarDunkirk,3.0,"Rafael ""Parker!!""

72648,Devil Times Five,1974, The font for the opening credits couldn t be more of its time  bold  curlicued yellow lettering  Together with the wintry vibes emanating from the snowbound vistas of the San Bernardino National Forest area  it puts you in the mood for a cosy 70s slasher  The start is benign enough   a couple jovially preparing to go on a business vacation to a remote lodge   but you re immediately thrown for a loop by the fact these scenes are intercut with a mini bus careening off the road and tumbling down a hillside onto its side  A group of kids slowly emerge from the wreckage and as they begin trekking through the snow it becomes clear their destination will coincide with the couple s   an opulent house in the woods belonging to the seemingly notorious Papa Doc There s something off with these kids though  Instead of being shaken by the accident  we see one of their number casually pillaging items from the dead adult bodies in the overturned bus  Our suspicions are soon confirmed when we discover the bus was from some kind of school for mentally disturbed kids  Sure enough  what we have here is a cr che of mini homicidal maniacs  After Papa Doc and his assembled guests take pity on them and offer them refuge  what ensues is a gradual herd cull  The adults are too wrapped up in their own petty concerns to realize the danger they ve placed themselves in by inviting these kids into their home and it takes almost all of them to be picked off before it finally dawns on the remaining few who it is that poses the threat  What a bunch of morons This a weird film  Tonally  it doesn t really hang together  Far too much of it plays out like some  largely sexless and not especially funny  sex comedy  quite light  with a lot of inconsequential melodrama  The kids  despite their actions  are never in the slightest bit menacing   the one dressed in military fatigues even has his own jaunty little theme tune every time he appears on screen  Director Sean MacGregor makes some very strange decisions for the first kill  It inexplicably transitions from colour into sepia tones and is shot in super slo mo  dragging on for what feels like minutes  sapping all the life and danger out of it  By the end  it s like you ve awoken from a dream  with a vague memory of a murder having taken place  All the kills incorporate slo mo  which if not as excruciatingly drawn out as the first  don t help to ratchet up the fear factor either  The film also has a habit of throwing in freeze frames for no apparent reason  which just comes off as shonky editing  A word for the bath tub piranha kill though   that was pretty gnarly  Could have done with more like that The kids not being at all convincing as mentally deranged hellspawn I put that down to the fact they just aren t very good actors and have difficulty playing something other than what they are  which is a bunch of normal kids  The adults don t fare a lot better  from Papa Doc s scenery chewing irascibility to Lovely s horny airhead and the obligatory slow  slightly weird but well meaning handyman  Ralph It kind of held my interest  mainly to see these little bastards get their much deserved comeuppance but sadly that never happens  They basically butcher an entire household because it amuses them  I guess the original title Peopletoys is quite accurate in that respect  Really though  it just beggars belief that grown assed men of Rick and Papa Doc s stature wouldn t be able to handle this paltry collection of fun size bedlamites  Given  The Beginning  caption at the end  you could imagine sequels charting their growth into a Manson Family esque unit but I wouldn t have much interest in watching them and I can t imagine revisiting this origin story any time soon  Not a total write off   it has its moments   but on the whole  relatively bloodless  tame  tonally awkward and inconsistently paced ,2.5,WraithApe
72648,Devil Times Five,1974, An isolated cabin in the woods   snowed in  phone lines are down  nearest town is a million miles away  and the vehicles are totally fucked  It s just the perfect setting to have a bunch of dorky adults on a business trip getting absolutely BRUTALIZED by five psycho kids who got lost in a van accident on the way to the funny farm  The kills are creative as hell  kicking off with a slo mo torture session that sets the uncaring tone so perfectly  and just GOES for like five minutes straight of pitchforkin  and limb hammerin  madness  And man  that piranha bath alone made this 100  worth the watch Kooky weird 70 s horror at its most kookiest  Fun stuff ,4.0,Matt Winfield

26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, 2nd Nick Grinde  after The Man They Could Not Hang A disappointingly turgid film that manages to spoil even the presence of Karloff  Returning to the same narrative concept as TMTCNH  here it s the restorative properties of ice  and indeed hot coffee  to not only prolong life but to cure cancer  And you thought The Devil Commands was WooWoo Central  The film s first mistake is to not have Karloff appear until the fifteen minute mark  Instead  we get a milquetoast doctor and his nurse lover following in Karloff s footsteps  When Karloff does appear  the film is then trapped in three small rooms as the characters become increasingly frustrating on both sides of the moral aisle  Karloff displays his seething contempt for humanity as in TM  but here with extra Nietzsche  but those he froze ten years before the film starts are thoroughly irritating SOBs who you wish had never been defrosted  Add to that a mumbo jumbo subplot about poison somehow affecting freezing rates and you ve got a recipe for dreariness  How did they manage to turn Karloff into such a stiff too  He s practically sleepwalking through this  Not a film I d return to voluntarily  and mercifully I can t see this appearing in my thesis beyond a one line mention  One to scrub from the Memory Bank Grinde in Order 1  The Man They Could Not Hang2  The Man with Nine LivesAdded to my Thesis Film List ,2.0,Dr. Ethan Lyon

26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, For a film that boils cryogenics down to piling ice on top of people it sure spends a lot of running time talking faux science to try and make you think there s a semblance of legitimacy to it Karloff is his usual wonderful self but everyone else is bland  Never really found its pace for me  Some nicely lit shots in the bunker  Disappointing as I really enjoyed The Man They Could Not Hang ,2.0,Calvin Dyson

26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, After nearly a decade as a monster star for Universal  Boris Karloff slid over to Columbia for a series of low rent  Mad Doctor  potboilers  five over a four year stretch  from  39 42  In NINE LIVES  Karloff is a scientist intent on curing ailments by freezing patients  The authorities  predictably  aren t impressed A protracted and talky intro details a modern doctor  Roger Pryor s experiments in the field that Karloff pioneered   wait for it    before his mysterious disappearance  In search of Karloff s records  Pryor discovers a secret underground lair complete with Fortress of Solitude style ice chamber  Is the missing doctor s body frozen inside  Will he be thawed out to complete his experiments  Will stubborn and short sighted cops try to stifle him  You betcha The science aspects of the plot will make a modern audience howl  bodies are put under via blocks of ice cubes placed on their chests  and revived by drinking hot coffee  Beyond that  the search capture experiment escape section of the flick is effectively done  Karloff s secret lab  replete with secret doors  staircases  and sub chamber after creepy sub chamber  is pretty great  much of the action takes place there without the pic feeling set bound or cheap And the best aspect of the story is forward thinking Boris  desperate and sincere pleading with the numb skulled authorities who just want to shut him down and jail him  His quartet of foes include a district attorney  sheriff  narrow minded doctor  and hot headed young heir of a rich family  Nice microcosm of the stereotypical bad guys we fight in this world  eh As with the other films from this era of his career  Karloff brings class  decency and sincerity in his performance  thereby raising the trappings of a grade Z pic to  say  a quality B  Can you imagine a George Zucco or even Lugosi in a film like this  With no offense to those guys  Karloff can make even a tepid stew seem tasty  This one s worth sampling if only for his presence  6 10 Viewed on DVD from Mill Creek s Boris Karloff Collection  6 Movie Set ,3.0,Billy Wiggins
26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, Karloff plays a doctor who has discovered cryogenics and wants to gift it to the world of medicine but is forced into extreme measures  including murder  by a bunch of fools who try to stop his experiments  We re supposed to think he is a mad doctor  but personally I found him to be the only sympathetic character in the whole movie  Everyone else is an idiot  a greedy bastard  a pompous ass  or all of the above  meddling in things they don t understand  It s entertaining  however  the bulk of the film  in which a group of people is held hostage as guinea pigs  and deservedly so  hinges on a rather unbelievable premise  that a genius scientist is unable to remember three little numbers which are the proportions of chemicals in a solution he created  nor can he remember the thought processes that led to the numbers  So  he continues to experiment and they continue to try to thwart him at every turn  And finally it ends in one man basically taking the credit for another s work  So  it s frustrating  but probably all too realistic in its portrayals of the natures of men s egos and personalities  What it is not is a horror movie in any way whatsoever  Often  it gets lumped into horror collections when it really should be in a sci fi or suspense category  Regardless  it s fascinating and tells you all you need to know about the condition of Walt Disney s body  lurking beneath Walt Disney World even as we speak  LOL  Just kidding ,3.5,Michael Shawn

26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, 2nd Nick Grinde  after The Man They Could Not Hang A disappointingly turgid film that manages to spoil even the presence of Karloff  Returning to the same narrative concept as TMTCNH  here it s the restorative properties of ice  and indeed hot coffee  to not only prolong life but to cure cancer  And you thought The Devil Commands was WooWoo Central  The film s first mistake is to not have Karloff appear until the fifteen minute mark  Instead  we get a milquetoast doctor and his nurse lover following in Karloff s footsteps  When Karloff does appear  the film is then trapped in three small rooms as the characters become increasingly frustrating on both sides of the moral aisle  Karloff displays his seething contempt for humanity as in TM  but here with extra Nietzsche  but those he froze ten years before the film starts are thoroughly irritating SOBs who you wish had never been defrosted  Add to that a mumbo jumbo subplot about poison somehow affecting freezing rates and you ve got a recipe for dreariness  How did they manage to turn Karloff into such a stiff too  He s practically sleepwalking through this  Not a film I d return to voluntarily  and mercifully I can t see this appearing in my thesis beyond a one line mention  One to scrub from the Memory Bank Grinde in Order 1  The Man They Could Not Hang2  The Man with Nine LivesAdded to my Thesis Film List ,2.0,Dr. Ethan Lyon

26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, Continuing my Karloff at Columbia set from Eureka  The concept is more of the same when compared to The Man They Could Not Hang but I quite like it and it s understandable since it s written by the same guy  Karl Brown  It s still a very fun sci fi thriller that delivers what you d expect and is hugely benefited by having Boris Karloff in it  It has the silliness but also is tense and engaging  and the suspense is surprisingly effective in the third act  It is fast paced and makes for a nice entertainment  Karloff once again shows his range and nails his character incredibly well  Always great to see this man in action 3rd film from Eureka  Karloff at Columbia  set ,3.0,sirvived
26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, For a film that boils cryogenics down to piling ice on top of people it sure spends a lot of running time talking faux science to try and make you think there s a semblance of legitimacy to it Karloff is his usual wonderful self but everyone else is bland  Never really found its pace for me  Some nicely lit shots in the bunker  Disappointing as I really enjoyed The Man They Could Not Hang ,2.0,Calvin Dyson
26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, Moving to  modern  day in Eureka s first Karloff set with The Man with Nine Lives  which opens with a humorous demonstration of a new medical advancement  frozen therapy  or  piling a bunch of ice cubes on top of a patient It s not long before another mad doctor iteration is being thawed out of a cryogenics chamber  A testament to his screen presence  we see Karloff play extensively with bubbling beakers and intimidate every man in the room as he does so They absolutely pile on the science babble here  and it s lighter fare compared to Nick Grinde and Karloff s previous collaboration  The Man They Could Not Hang but still fun enough ,3.0,Brett & JB
26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, Pretty standard fare that s lacks the excitement of The Man they Could not Hang  We re fully in movie land here though as people are frozen to  100 and revived with coffee through a funnel and nobody reacts in any way resembling a real human being   It s 1940  you ve been frozen for ten years   oh damn really  Bet I ve got a lot of mail to go home to  What s here though is entertaining enough in a quick and to the point manner  no romance or character development sub plots here ,3.0,Aidan Bates
26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, After nearly a decade as a monster star for Universal  Boris Karloff slid over to Columbia for a series of low rent  Mad Doctor  potboilers  five over a four year stretch  from  39 42  In NINE LIVES  Karloff is a scientist intent on curing ailments by freezing patients  The authorities  predictably  aren t impressed A protracted and talky intro details a modern doctor  Roger Pryor s experiments in the field that Karloff pioneered   wait for it    before his mysterious disappearance  In search of Karloff s records  Pryor discovers a secret underground lair complete with Fortress of Solitude style ice chamber  Is the missing doctor s body frozen inside  Will he be thawed out to complete his experiments  Will stubborn and short sighted cops try to stifle him  You betcha The science aspects of the plot will make a modern audience howl  bodies are put under via blocks of ice cubes placed on their chests  and revived by drinking hot coffee  Beyond that  the search capture experiment escape section of the flick is effectively done  Karloff s secret lab  replete with secret doors  staircases  and sub chamber after creepy sub chamber  is pretty great  much of the action takes place there without the pic feeling set bound or cheap And the best aspect of the story is forward thinking Boris  desperate and sincere pleading with the numb skulled authorities who just want to shut him down and jail him  His quartet of foes include a district attorney  sheriff  narrow minded doctor  and hot headed young heir of a rich family  Nice microcosm of the stereotypical bad guys we fight in this world  eh As with the other films from this era of his career  Karloff brings class  decency and sincerity in his performance  thereby raising the trappings of a grade Z pic to  say  a quality B  Can you imagine a George Zucco or even Lugosi in a film like this  With no offense to those guys  Karloff can make even a tepid stew seem tasty  This one s worth sampling if only for his presence  6 10 Viewed on DVD from Mill Creek s Boris Karloff Collection  6 Movie Set ,3.0,Billy Wiggins
26924,The Man with Nine Lives,1940, Karloff plays a doctor who has discovered cryogenics and wants to gift it to the world of medicine but is forced into extreme measures  including murder  by a bunch of fools who try to stop his experiments  We re supposed to think he is a mad doctor  but personally I found him to be the only sympathetic character in the whole movie  Everyone else is an idiot  a greedy bastard  a pompous ass  or all of the above  meddling in things they don t understand  It s entertaining  however  the bulk of the film  in which a group of people is held hostage as guinea pigs  and deservedly so  hinges on a rather unbelievable premise  that a genius scientist is unable to remember three little numbers which are the proportions of chemicals in a solution he created  nor can he remember the thought processes that led to the numbers  So  he continues to experiment and they continue to try to thwart him at every turn  And finally it ends in one man basically taking the credit for another s work  So  it s frustrating  but probably all too realistic in its portrayals of the natures of men s egos and personalities  What it is not is a horror movie in any way whatsoever  Often  it gets lumped into horror collections when it really should be in a sci fi or suspense category  Regardless  it s fascinating and tells you all you need to know about the condition of Walt Disney s body  lurking beneath Walt Disney World even as we speak  LOL  Just kidding ,3.5,Michael Shawn

2363,The Cousins,1959, The city mouse and the country mouse scratch and tear each other s eyes out from a desire to escape sin in Claude Chabrol s  The Cousins Chabrol s second work  actually intended as his first  though its production endured longer than that of  Le Beau Serge  the film takes the two male leads of  Serge  and recasts them in swapped roles of who assumes the part of the outsider Cousins  with its upper middle class ennui deluded to drunkenness with champagne and Catholic guilt  assures Chabrol as the Nouvelle Vague s nearest child of ma tre du suspense  Hitchcock While Chabrol does not quite achieve the intricacy of plot or montage of Hitchcock  first  Serge  and then  Cousins  do surpass the British director in their existential religious hand wringing Hitchcock s most overtly Catholic feature   I Confess  is severely handicapped by a mismatch of director and lead actor in Montgomery Clift  Chabrol not only pairs to marvelous ends with his stars in  Serge  and  Cousins  but the reuse of the pair between entries turn the back to back films into a sweeping portrait of how   city or country   guilt follows everywhere  The relentlessly pursuing beast of Catholicism Cousins  with its bleak fatalism  is an essential early work of the Nouvelle Vague  It also separates Chabrol immediately from his contemporaries  and places him closer in sensibility to his idol of Hitchcock  Where Truffaut and Godard shot neorealism tinged portraits of marginal strivers on the street  Chabrol sought for the same pathos  but focused on the lapsed faithful struggling within their apartment parlors  The ends though  are always the same Where to Begin  French New Wave,4.0,theriverjordan
2363,The Cousins,1959, Claude Chabrol s brilliant sophomore effort  Les cousins  is a character study on how tension could gradually rise between two completely different individuals and the serious consequence it entails  The plot is put into motion when Charles arrives in the Parisian apartment of his cousin Paul Thomas  played by Jean Claude Brialy  one of the greats who s worked with practically every filmmaker associated with Cahiers du cin ma such as Jean Luc Godard  Jacques Rivette  and Eric Rohmer  Paul warmly welcomes his cousin and  from then on  the two will be living under the same roof as they re both students of a nearby college  But the similarities end there  If Charles is devoutly studious with much focus and drive  then his cousin s the polar opposite  Paul is a flamboyantly care free and promiscuous creature  even sporting a devilish  killer beard  Charles soon gets to meet his cousin s rowdy bunch of friends through a party of such Babylonian decadence  Now enter Florence  played by the sexy Juliette Mayniel who I recognized as the beauty from the fantastic Eyes Without a Face  She flirts and easily wins over the heart of Charles  However  fully knowing Florence s nature  Paul disapproves and snatches her away from his cousin The film is seeped in the style of the French New Wave  Chabrol directs with calm detachment  employing most of the tricks of the movement  e g  jarring jump cuts  a breezy jazz score  the three way romance  and even a prominently displayed Chekhov s gun  He paints a cool portrait of student life in late 50s Paris  The party scenes are really something too  In the first of Paul s wild soir es  he puts on a Wagner record and ostentatiously reenacts a scene from  ironically  Tristan and Isolde  Amid all this reveling  Charles is ensconced in a quieter part of the room with Florence expressing his love  This divide between the cousins will be a familiar  clever motif throughout My favorite scene is a relatively unassuming one  Florence sun bathes in the terrace of their apartment  half naked simmering with raw animalistic power and seduction  Upon closer inspection  the balcony railing makes it look like she s inside a cage  Paul walks in the terrace  gently caresses her back and then pats her on the head like a pet  Charles only gets to look  never touching Florence in her cage  Again this visual  symbolic schism between the two is portrayed to full effect Les cousins is an archetypal Chabrol film  years before becoming the French Hitchcock  This is far from the bloody  brutal movies that he will be known for  But it is still such a great early entry to the French New Wave movement that I absolutely enjoyed ,4.0,ButtNugget

2363,The Cousins,1959, Claude Chabrol s brilliant sophomore effort  Les cousins  is a character study on how tension could gradually rise between two completely different individuals and the serious consequence it entails  The plot is put into motion when Charles arrives in the Parisian apartment of his cousin Paul Thomas  played by Jean Claude Brialy  one of the greats who s worked with practically every filmmaker associated with Cahiers du cin ma such as Jean Luc Godard  Jacques Rivette  and Eric Rohmer  Paul warmly welcomes his cousin and  from then on  the two will be living under the same roof as they re both students of a nearby college  But the similarities end there  If Charles is devoutly studious with much focus and drive  then his cousin s the polar opposite  Paul is a flamboyantly care free and promiscuous creature  even sporting a devilish  killer beard  Charles soon gets to meet his cousin s rowdy bunch of friends through a party of such Babylonian decadence  Now enter Florence  played by the sexy Juliette Mayniel who I recognized as the beauty from the fantastic Eyes Without a Face  She flirts and easily wins over the heart of Charles  However  fully knowing Florence s nature  Paul disapproves and snatches her away from his cousin The film is seeped in the style of the French New Wave  Chabrol directs with calm detachment  employing most of the tricks of the movement  e g  jarring jump cuts  a breezy jazz score  the three way romance  and even a prominently displayed Chekhov s gun  He paints a cool portrait of student life in late 50s Paris  The party scenes are really something too  In the first of Paul s wild soir es  he puts on a Wagner record and ostentatiously reenacts a scene from  ironically  Tristan and Isolde  Amid all this reveling  Charles is ensconced in a quieter part of the room with Florence expressing his love  This divide between the cousins will be a familiar  clever motif throughout My favorite scene is a relatively unassuming one  Florence sun bathes in the terrace of their apartment  half naked simmering with raw animalistic power and seduction  Upon closer inspection  the balcony railing makes it look like she s inside a cage  Paul walks in the terrace  gently caresses her back and then pats her on the head like a pet  Charles only gets to look  never touching Florence in her cage  Again this visual  symbolic schism between the two is portrayed to full effect Les cousins is an archetypal Chabrol film  years before becoming the French Hitchcock  This is far from the bloody  brutal movies that he will be known for  But it is still such a great early entry to the French New Wave movement that I absolutely enjoyed ,4.0,ButtNugget

59902,Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw,1976, Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw  1976  is a movie that I recently watched on Tubi  The storyline follows a naive girl looking for a life of adventure and speed  One day she unknowingly runs into a guy who stole a car and is on the run from the law  She decides he s the adventure she s looking for  When she discovers who and what he is it only gets her more excited that she made the right decision to join him This movie is directed by Mark L  Lester  Firestarter  and stars Marjoe Gortner  Earthquake  Lynda Carter  Wonder Woman  Jesse Vint  Chinatown  Merrie Lynn Ross  Class of 1984  and Belinda Balaski  The Howling Lynda Carter was an absolute smoke show in this  She was stunning  The cars  depiction of the time and era and chase scenes were amazing  The shootouts were also well done and the pinball sequence was fun  Every nude scene is tremendous  It was entertaining watching things go from Zen to crazy quick and Bobbie Jo s evolution was well written and portrayed  The conclusion of this movie is the only way it could end This is an underrated grindhouse gem that I absolutely loved  I would score this an 8 10 and would strongly recommend it ,4.0,Kevin_Robbins
59902,Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw,1976, Lynda Carter is Bobbie Jo  a carhop in a New Mexico drive in burger joint  She s weary of her small town life and fed up with her religious  hypocritical  controlling mother  who swigs secret booze from a Visine squirt bottle  So when hunky Lyle  Marjoe Gortner  shows up in a fabulous muscle car  she runs off with him It is soon revealed that Lyle is a criminal and an outlaw with a Billy The Kid fixation  Bobbie Jo discovers that she can get down with this lifestyle  at one point  when she machine guns a man to death  she manically and somewhat gleefully proclaims  I made him dance  Eventually  the gang expands to include Bobbie Jo s best friend Essie  her stripper sister Pearl  and Pearl s boyfriend manager Slick  They cross New Mexico on a crime spree filled with robbery and killing Bobbie Jo And The Outlaw was filmed in New Mexico and there is much gorgeous desert scenery in this flick  The car that Lyle drives is definitely one of the stars of the movie  A quick bit of research reveals it to be a 1970 Mustang painted  Grabber Orange  This magnificent muscle machine is involved in a number of the cool car chases and vehicle stunts with which the movie is peppered  One of my favorite scenes is when the gang is skinny dipping with a Native American grandfather who is ingesting sacred mushrooms with them  But even better than that is the long scene with a Gottlieb Duotron pinball machine  many fabulous closeups of the graphics and backglass and table  The movie also reveals that with the advance of technology  some things are lost  For example  if Lyle lived in the current era when cars mostly don t have aerials any more  he wouldn t have been able to break one off and defend himself by using it as a lash against the gang of knife wielding barflies who were pissed off at him for hustling them at pinball So  in Bobbie Jo And The Outlaw we get some gorgeous scenery  some of the natural and some of the nude variety  a magnificent muscle car and some spiffy vehicle action  and a series of heists that occasionally result in bloody mayhem  Lynda Carter is the standout castmember here  but every performer is quite good  This was a pretty fabulous flick ,4.0,LordSlaw
59902,Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw,1976, Rural sexploitation action comedy flicks were a dime a dozen in the 1970s  Judging Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw within the scope of that subgenre  I d rate it above average by virtue of AIP s usual quality on a budget production standards  Whether through ace casting savvy or sheer luck  this movie really capitalizes on its stars  Lynda Carter  who appears topless in several scenes  became a household name by playing Wonder Woman on TV around the same time this film was released  The male lead  Marjoe Gortner  was a former child celebrity Pentecostal preacher  He was ordained at the age of four and exploited by his parents for millions of dollars on the revival tent circuit  Watching those two squeaky clean personas play sexed up  violent  Bonnie and Clyde esque outlaws must ve been a hoot for audiences catching this at a drive in theater  Merrie Lynn Ross  who later became a peace activist and shaman  is also on hand as a pretty bad girl accomplice In one ridiculous scene  a weasely thug with a greasy mullet and a 70s porn  stache challenges Gortner to a game of pinball for a wager  Everybody in the bar watches the silverball match in suspense as 40 bucks and a potential brawl hang in the balance  It s a fun homage to Tommy and a sly bit of absurdist comedy BJO was filmed on location in New Mexico  The country music score is by Barry De Vorzon  The twangy theme song  Those City Lights  is performed by Bobby Bare ,3.5,Moronic Inferno
59902,Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw,1976, Bonnie and Clyde rip driven by topless women and the viewer s probable derision for the titular Outlaw  who s exactly the kind of dick that Beatty s Clyde wasn t  You don t wanna be on a mushroom trip with this guy  Lyle  cheater at pinball  He could be worse  I guess  Bobbie Jo s empty head gets filled with the thrills and joys of murder  Quite a turnaround for her bored  beautiful small town car hop character who sings country songs among desert ruins  She just needed someone to drive away with her life  Her buddy Essie gets razzed by the Outlaw  he does get nicer  and receives a leaded raw deal from the police despite her coolness and never fucking anything up  By the time the vengeful cosmos comes for her  she d taken my crush for Bobbie Jo  Plot cheats galore  as with many of this type of film  just keep things moving when you can   We re gonna need guns  says the Outlaw  and CUT to the gang holding M 16s  etc  Mostly lame action  I mean these characters don t seem motivated to take COVER when the bullets fly  but the film provides an adequate number of fiery  illogical explosions  On the same level as Dirty Mary Crazy Larry  an empty ride but with a much lamer pay off ,2.5,John S.
59902,Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw,1976, BOBBIE JO AND THE OUTLAW is an odd film that while staying true to its drive in roots is still nonetheless unsatisfying  It definitely carries all the hallmarks of the genre  bloody carnage  car chases  bare breasts and a nihilistic ending  Where it missteps is in its ambition  where the filmmakers seem to be saying something but it so hopelessly muddled that the film comes off as bewildering Our main  anti hero  Lyle  imagines himself as Billy The Kid  wandering around looking for light trouble  but sticking to a code  It is with his arc that the film falters as we are never sure what to make of him  He is mostly good natured  just wanting to have some fun and commit some minor larceny  He carries around a book of the old west that he reads from like scripture which says that bad deeds go punished  setting himself up for a showdown with bullets  yet the performance by Gortner doesn t quite gel with that description  Gortner s casting is a problem as he is too old for the part  This character needs to be younger and more impetuous for this to sell  As it plays with Gortner  Lyle just comes off as a loser with no direction in life Carter  lovely in ways I hadn t seen before  is much more sure footed  playing the naivety of a small town girl trying to escape the boredom of her life  I do think the way she becomes more hardened as the film goes on works well Unfortunately this duo is saddled with companions that drag the movie down  They are ill conceived and bland and do nothing but distract us from the titular duo that the film should be focusing on  To make things worse  the law enforcement chasing them are so inept and morally wrong that their victory at the end feels empty and false This movie could have been saved with some script changes and tightening up the casting  It could have been a grindhouse classic rather than just a remnant of the era ,2.0,dantesring

28169,The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie,1989, Still just as silly and cartoonish as ever and full of those late night cable vibes  this is the trash I watched in my bedroom as a kid late at night with the door locked  This is the trash that started my life long love affair with all trash so of course I love it It isn t the classic the first one is or as truly bizarre and overstuffed with weirdness as the second one  but this one has plenty of incredible gore including Satan crawling out of someone s chest Alien style and Toxie melting and then reforming into his old self  They re honestly pretty amazing The second half of the movie  while plenty entertaining  lacks the magic of the first half  They switch to a video game style format between Satan and Toxie and it s all just a little more drawn out than it needs to be  Although  points for that delightful Wizard of Oz reference Also Phoebe Legere as Toxie s girlfriend is nothing but pure delight  It s almost like she can t move without gyrating her vajeen and I am all in for it No I m absolutely not kidding  It s fantastic ,3.5,Tony the Terror üéÑ
28169,The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie,1989, Wow  I m actually kind of amazed at just how quickly this franchise fell apart  I loved the first one  kind of liked the second  and was just completely disappointed with the third  The plot doesn t even try to make sense  Somehow  despite having fought against them in the previous film  Toxie is perfectly fine with working for Apocalypse Inc  and turning a blind eye to their actions  This is made even more ridiculous when you consider the fact that the previous film established that Toxie s Tromatons act up when he s in the presence of evil  causing him to go into a berserker rage and tear apart any evil individuals he comes in contact with  Yet  his Tromatons somehow sense nothing from any of the members of Apocalypse Inc  including the devil himself  Furthermore  the plot feels like it drags on far too long  and most of the entertaining gore and creative kills from the first film and  to a lesser extent  the second  are almost completely gone here  And  it seems Kaufman is aware of just how bad this is  I took a quick peek at Citizen Toxie  The Toxic Avenger IV  and discovered that it opens with narration by Stan Lee  explaining that the last two sequels were crap and that Citizen Toxie is the true sequel to the original  As much as I loved The Toxic Avenger  I just wasn t on board for this one ,2.5,Tears_in_Rain
28169,The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie,1989, I think I might ve rated the second film a bit too highly  because I really enjoyed this one a lot more  Yeah it lacks the gore except for one scene  which is apparently heavily cut on Amazon  I don t know why  But there are some fantastic special effects littered throughout  like the melting scene and the devils emergence  Or at least effects I love  tbf they re not amazing aha This movie is entirely different to the previous two  it sets up with Toxie somehow forgetting who the evil company is  And reusing footage from the previous movie cheaply  but I ll forgive those two points  As Toxie gets a job  And works for the evil dudes  and personally I just found the costumes Toxie was wearing hilarious  And him carrying out mundane tasks and being a yuppie were very funny scenes  it s pretty weird as well because whoever plays him is a decent actor now  Even Claire his girlfriend  even if she hams it up a lot more  In fact these movies as a whole are very competently made  and decently acted  Odd for Troma I suppose this series is their prize pony though  As they frequently remind you of the budget  and the existence of the movies via the VHS store scene  And meta lines that Toxie frequently spouts out I have to say the ending with the devil does drag a bit  and it becomes super cheesy if it wasn t already  But it s still good fun  the whole movie up until then was just so much more enjoyable  I m pretty excited to watch the next one now  I ve heard it s pretty well liked Also if you don t find people being threatened to puke at gunpoint  for no real reason unfunny  You re watching the wrong movie   I wanna see you puke ya bastards ,4.5,Cameron

31293,Love in the City,1953, A compendium of film essays developed by Cesare Zavattini  the theoretical wizard of Italian neorealism  and directed by five of Italy s most prominent filmmakers  Antonioni  Fellini  Lizzani  Risi  and Lattuada  I love the historical significance at play  The film reaches back to Vertov s Kino Pravda newsreels from the 1920s  where fragments of actuality were captured cinematically to reveal the pedestrian realities of everyday life  It also reaches forward to set the foundation for cin ma v rit  during the next decade  inspiring one of my favorite films of the era  Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin s CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER  1961 LOVE IN THE CITY exists somewhere between fiction and documentary  a journalistic expos  that observes nonactors playing themselves in dramatized situations  The subject at hand  Mostly taboo topics  Suicide  prostitution  single motherhood  the uber male gaze  etc  all bound through an omnibus aesthetic that shows the relationships between men and women in modern Rome  Fellini s segment is the most staged  but also the most visually exciting  A surreal little story that dreamily glides through a marriage agency while riffing on the cross section between love and werewolves  Definitely the standout among all five shorts  As a whole  the film is an interesting social experiment that v rit  geeks will eat up Fellini Ranked,2.5,BrandonHabes
31293,Love in the City,1953, Promising premises that end up being barely held together by the talented people in the director chairs  Too many ideas and too little time  with varying degrees of success  This is why I generally stay away from anthologies  The shift of focus and styles becomes too jarring and you end up never getting a good feel for anyone involved I watched this mostly for Fellini and  although his part is not the worse  its the segment that breaks the most from the surrounding ones  I was genuinely enjoying the type of pre v rit  that was presented to start the film and would ve loved for it to be more focused in that direction  No one did a bad job but it was too scattered overall ,2.5,goncaloacosta
31293,Love in the City,1953, Six filmmakers chip in  each with a different slant on the deliberately blurred line between documentary and fiction  Dino Risi did a lovely little thing about courting behavior during a dance band s gig at some neighborhood palace  said more in ten or fifteen minutes than some similarly pitched eastern european movies could do in ninety The one that really takes the prize  though  is Lattuada s closing segment  brilliantly theorizing that ol  male gaze twenty years before Mulvey  it starts out as a smirky  larky thing about the to be looked atness of Roman women  and then it brings the men who do the looking into the picture  and then it evolves into an emotionally draining  if not downright  terrifying  social experiment movie  Yoko Ono style  Even experiencing it vicariously is stressful ,3.5,Lencho of the Apes

31293,Love in the City,1953, As a cross section of Italy s established and rising filmmakers  Love in the City is perhaps most revealing for what it bares of the possibilities and increasingly visible limits of the nation s neorealism   Paid Love  for example  ends up speaking on behalf of its subjects  introducing them with a degree of condescension about their  sad lives  before verit  interviews ask loaded questions that acknowledge the economic circumstances that drive many of the women to sex work while simplistically asking if they d like to leave the life  Meanwhile  Antonioni hints at both his modernist spirit and the underlying soul beneath his ostensibly cold  glittering surfaces in his empathetic but almost Brechtian interrogation of those who survived suicide attempts  The short introduces its subjects marching in file before the giant paper backdrops of  real  films  of imprints of buildings on sheets that droop behind a giant white screen as if the real people were being projected in real time onto it  Later  he has them return to the scenes of their suicide attempts  prompting quasi recreations that both deepen and shatter the veneer of realism  Yet this alienating effect also strips away the distractions that plagued the first segment  and the subjects are given more latitude to account for themselves without judgment  at times pausing to search for the words to voice what they ve never said aloud  Antonioni also highlights the romantic and economic anxieties that inform a lot of these people s depressed thoughts  but in this context we see the mingling of external and internal strife in a way he would master at narrativizing in the following decade  Even here  he is leagues ahead of his peers Of the remaining segments  Risi s flippant  underdeveloped view of teens dancing and flirting  along with the pure misery porn of  Story of Caterina  are the most traditionally neorealist and thus the the ones that seem the most aged  The closing  Italians Stare  turns that style on its head  embodying the leering  sexual hunger of chauvinist Italian men on the prowl whether capturing the way men s heads turn for literally any woman or embodying those gazes through the camera  The best  of course  is Fellini  who is already embracing the dream logic and opulent musicality that would fully explode in La Dolce Vita and beyond  As with Antonioni  he is so clearly chafing at neorealism s limits  and watching him stretch those boundaries until they rupture is a joy ,3.0,Jake Cole
31293,Love in the City,1953, Love in the City is a hit and miss omnibus crafted by some soon to be renowned Italian filmmakers  I absolutely love the concept  The opening narration pitches it as a news magazine brought to life   The first two segments are in documentary form  It s interesting to watch such early docs because the compulsion to make things cinematic is still there  So while it doesn t always seem authentic  it does feel socially conscious  In fact  the whole film feels socially conscious   Paid Love  is a series of testimonials from prostitutes about their day to day struggle and personal histories  It s trying its best to be sincere  but the interviewer behind the camera can t help but offer condescending life advice to the women   Attempted Suicide  directed by Michelangelo Antonioni  focuses on exactly that  He interviews a series of women about their reasons for doing it and whether they re happy to still be alive  It s compelling and honest  and you can see the director s sensibilities at work  Dino Risi directs  3 Hours of Paradise  and it s a big pretty piece of nothing  Teenagers dancing  having cute and funny romantic interactions  boys getting slapped  shot down  wallflowers  It s just a beautifully choreographed yet overlong slice of life with no story or character to latch onto Fellini s  Marriage Agency  is dynamite  The director was already highly acclaimed with I Vitelloni  His craftsmanship blows everything else out of the water in terms of visual style  It s a strange and somewhat surreal story stuck in the middle of some very grounded shorts  But even with Fellini setting the world on fire  Francesco Maselli sweeps in with  Story of Caterina  to take the prize  This is a perfect slice of Italian Neo realism  It shows the daily trials a woman trying to take care of her infant son  It goes deep into the details of her toil and shows exactly why this life is so fucking hard  It s gut punch cinema and I love it But let s end on a happy note I guess  Yeah let s play some dance music and follow hot women around  Zoom in on their tits  Show their hips shake  Show all the other passers by gawking at them  That s all  Italians Stare  is  It s weird  It gets worse when a creepy mouth breather follows a girl all the way to her hotel  She goes in and he lingers outside until finally giving up  That s how our exceedingly empathetic slice of life anthology ends  a pervert disappointedly not getting to grope a chick today and wandering off to a  womp womp  sound  That shit ain t cute  Love in the City does not stick the landing ,3.5,Xebeche

31293,Love in the City,1953, If I could  I d do it again  but this time I want to die One of the better anthology pieces I ve ever seen because of the way it meshes into one  Each piece is distinct but works towards the grander idea of finding as experiencing love in a big city  My favorite segment was  Michelangelo Antonioni s though Fellini s is right up there That being said the transition from story it story is rough and just as you re adjusted it switches  It s wonderful but has issues most anthologies do  mostly the weaker segments being  very  weak  Still worth the watch Would Recommend ,,Hayden Welch
31293,Love in the City,1953, Cuando el mundo y el ser humano pod an ser pensados a trav s del cine  Cuando en cada plano se jugaba una cuesti n moral  el peso de las ideas  la dignidad humana  Aunque no soy mucho de pel culas epis dicas  esta funciona como compendio de la idea del neorrealismo en el cine  y s lo el  ltimo segmento  el brillante ejercicio de montaje de Alberto Lattuada para desenmascarar una sociedad italiana movida por la cultura de la violaci n  parece desentonar un poco en el conjunto Las dos primeras partes  las de Lizzani y Antonioni  consisten en entrevistas a sus protagonistas  Las primeras  prostitutas que se mueven en la noche  como apartadas del mundo real  las segundas  supervivientes de suicidios que recrean sus experiencias  Antonioni los reune en un espacio abstracto  una gran habitaci n flanqueada por grandes s banas blancas que podr an ser las pantallas de un cine  y de los testimonios se salta a una reelaboraci n ficcionada de sus suicidios La m s hermosa de todas las pel culas es la de Dino Risi  que se limita a ser una descripci n minuciosa de un momento de vida en un sal n de baile al que acuden j venes y no tan j venes en busca del amor  o simplemente una v a de escape al mundo opresivo que reflejaban los dos episodios previos  Risi muestra simplemente los cuerpos bailando  los rostros mirando con miedo y deseo  los tiempos muertos en silencio  esperando a una nueva canci n  a una nueva oportunidad para encontrar otro ser solitario al que unirse durante unos minutos  Sin contexto  sin historia  sin gui n ni desarrollo argumental  el cineasta consigue transmitir desesperaci n en la belleza  o viceversa  No hace falta nada m s que una c mara en el lugar adecuado  a la altura necesaria y el tiempo exacto Fellini plantea la pel cula m s cl sica del conjunto  La historia de un hombre que investiga los negocios de las agencias matrimoniales  Se inventa la historia de un hombre monstruoso que busca una mujer que le acompa e en una vida de sufrimiento  La candidata aparece  y resulta ser un  ngel  dispuesta a todo por tener una vida  incluso amar y dar cari o a ese ficticio hombre lobo  Camino a conocer a ese hombre que no existe  el protagonista y la mujer hablan frente a un paisaje yermo  la inmensidad del espacio choca con los cuerpos de  l y de ella sentados  en una imagen t pica del neorrealismo  Finalmente  el protagonista le dice que no es la elegida y regresan a la ciudad  Uno de los grandes logros del neorrealismo fue el de enmarcar un anecd tico drama individual en el fundamental devenir de una tragedia colectiva  sabiendo medir las diferencias entre la intimidad de ese individuo y su valor como imagen de toda una sociedad  algo que se ha trasladado hasta hoy  pero de forma mucho menos afortunada  por la falta de altura moral y de compromiso de los cineastas a trav s de la c mara Respecto a esto  ltimo  es imposible no acordarse  viendo la bell sima Storia di Caterina de Francesco Maselli  en que un a o antes los italianos  y concretamente el Festival de Venecia  descubrieron a Kenji Mizoguchi  Caterina  la joven protagonista del film  sobrevive a un intento de suicidio  a la violaci n y al parto de un hijo ileg timo  al que no puede alimentar  Sin trabajo y sin amigos  lo abandona y es juzgada por la sociedad  pero nunca por la c mara  Maselli se mantiene en un emocionado silencio y encuentra en los planos secuencia de su c mara la manera de expresar el debate moral de la protagonista  Cuando consigue que le presten cien liras  no se le ocurre otra cosa que gastarlas en unas cerezas  Entonces la vemos comiendo las cerezas con la cabeza gacha mientras la c mara la sigue en un travelling lateral  mientras en segundo t rmino vemos el tr fico y la vida continuando en Roma  ajeno a esa mujer desesperada y sin futuro  Al igual que en Saikaku ichidai onna  de Mizoguchi  por mucho que Caterina cometa actos que  en una mirada fr a y descontextualizada  puedan resultar criminales  jam s lo son  Y es el cine el que convierte su mirada y sus gestos de resistencia en algo hermoso  La continuidad dram tica  la forma de engrandecer su rostro y su cuerpo  de privilegiarla sobre todo lo dem s es la grandeza de esta pel cula extraordinaria De ah  que sea curioso el contraste con la pel cula de Lattuada  En ella vemos a mujeres por la calle y a hombres que se giran para mirarlas  En ocasiones  vemos a las mujeres sentadas o paradas en medio de la calle  planos que se intercalan con primeros planos de hombres  mir ndolas lascivamente  En otras ocasiones  las mujeres pasean mientras la c mara las sigue en travelling  mientras los hombres que se cruzan la miran con o sin pudor  Lo fascinante de la pel cula es c mo Lattuada segmenta los movimientos de las mujeres y los gestos de los hombres de una forma casi conceptual  pareciendo por momentos una pel cula sovi tica  o el ejemplo m s directo  Rear Window  de Alfred Hitchcock  La m sica rimbombante parece convertirlo todo en una broma macabra  pero creo que no es m s que una forma de ocultar  de tapar  el objetivo real  la condena de la mujer en un mundo dominado por la mirada masculina  algo que  a adido a los anteriores episodios  cobra much sima fuerza Compendio de los logros del cine italiano de aquel tiempo  Amore in citt  quiz s no tenga el nombre ni la fama de otros films colectivos  pero para mi es de los que m s me ha impresionado  Si alguien quiere entender lo que fue el neorrealismo y su importancia fundamental para la historia del cine  y del siglo XX  seguramente  sta y Pais  sean las dos mejores pel culas  junto a Las mujeres de Messina de Elio Vittorini  Si Pais  comenzaba con el final de la guerra que destruy  Italia  junto a los falsos sue os de grandeza del estado

31293,Love in the City,1953, Cesare Zavattini   legendary screenwriter and frequent collaborator of Vittorio De Sica   organised this omnibus film which was intended to be the first of a series of screen reviews allowing creative talents freedom to work in the short or documentary format  He gathered together an impressive array of talent   including Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini   for a fascinating picture in the neo realist style An intriguing document of its time ,3.5,trolleyfreak
31293,Love in the City,1953, A compendium of film essays developed by Cesare Zavattini  the theoretical wizard of Italian neorealism  and directed by five of Italy s most prominent filmmakers  Antonioni  Fellini  Lizzani  Risi  and Lattuada  I love the historical significance at play  The film reaches back to Vertov s Kino Pravda newsreels from the 1920s  where fragments of actuality were captured cinematically to reveal the pedestrian realities of everyday life  It also reaches forward to set the foundation for cin ma v rit  during the next decade  inspiring one of my favorite films of the era  Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin s CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER  1961 LOVE IN THE CITY exists somewhere between fiction and documentary  a journalistic expos  that observes nonactors playing themselves in dramatized situations  The subject at hand  Mostly taboo topics  Suicide  prostitution  single motherhood  the uber male gaze  etc  all bound through an omnibus aesthetic that shows the relationships between men and women in modern Rome  Fellini s segment is the most staged  but also the most visually exciting  A surreal little story that dreamily glides through a marriage agency while riffing on the cross section between love and werewolves  Definitely the standout among all five shorts  As a whole  the film is an interesting social experiment that v rit  geeks will eat up Fellini Ranked,2.5,BrandonHabes
31293,Love in the City,1953, Promising premises that end up being barely held together by the talented people in the director chairs  Too many ideas and too little time  with varying degrees of success  This is why I generally stay away from anthologies  The shift of focus and styles becomes too jarring and you end up never getting a good feel for anyone involved I watched this mostly for Fellini and  although his part is not the worse  its the segment that breaks the most from the surrounding ones  I was genuinely enjoying the type of pre v rit  that was presented to start the film and would ve loved for it to be more focused in that direction  No one did a bad job but it was too scattered overall ,2.5,goncaloacosta
31293,Love in the City,1953, Six filmmakers chip in  each with a different slant on the deliberately blurred line between documentary and fiction  Dino Risi did a lovely little thing about courting behavior during a dance band s gig at some neighborhood palace  said more in ten or fifteen minutes than some similarly pitched eastern european movies could do in ninety The one that really takes the prize  though  is Lattuada s closing segment  brilliantly theorizing that ol  male gaze twenty years before Mulvey  it starts out as a smirky  larky thing about the to be looked atness of Roman women  and then it brings the men who do the looking into the picture  and then it evolves into an emotionally draining  if not downright  terrifying  social experiment movie  Yoko Ono style  Even experiencing it vicariously is stressful ,3.5,Lencho of the Apes

31293,Love in the City,1953, As a cross section of Italy s established and rising filmmakers  Love in the City is perhaps most revealing for what it bares of the possibilities and increasingly visible limits of the nation s neorealism   Paid Love  for example  ends up speaking on behalf of its subjects  introducing them with a degree of condescension about their  sad lives  before verit  interviews ask loaded questions that acknowledge the economic circumstances that drive many of the women to sex work while simplistically asking if they d like to leave the life  Meanwhile  Antonioni hints at both his modernist spirit and the underlying soul beneath his ostensibly cold  glittering surfaces in his empathetic but almost Brechtian interrogation of those who survived suicide attempts  The short introduces its subjects marching in file before the giant paper backdrops of  real  films  of imprints of buildings on sheets that droop behind a giant white screen as if the real people were being projected in real time onto it  Later  he has them return to the scenes of their suicide attempts  prompting quasi recreations that both deepen and shatter the veneer of realism  Yet this alienating effect also strips away the distractions that plagued the first segment  and the subjects are given more latitude to account for themselves without judgment  at times pausing to search for the words to voice what they ve never said aloud  Antonioni also highlights the romantic and economic anxieties that inform a lot of these people s depressed thoughts  but in this context we see the mingling of external and internal strife in a way he would master at narrativizing in the following decade  Even here  he is leagues ahead of his peers Of the remaining segments  Risi s flippant  underdeveloped view of teens dancing and flirting  along with the pure misery porn of  Story of Caterina  are the most traditionally neorealist and thus the the ones that seem the most aged  The closing  Italians Stare  turns that style on its head  embodying the leering  sexual hunger of chauvinist Italian men on the prowl whether capturing the way men s heads turn for literally any woman or embodying those gazes through the camera  The best  of course  is Fellini  who is already embracing the dream logic and opulent musicality that would fully explode in La Dolce Vita and beyond  As with Antonioni  he is so clearly chafing at neorealism s limits  and watching him stretch those boundaries until they rupture is a joy ,3.0,Jake Cole
31293,Love in the City,1953, Love in the City is a hit and miss omnibus crafted by some soon to be renowned Italian filmmakers  I absolutely love the concept  The opening narration pitches it as a news magazine brought to life   The first two segments are in documentary form  It s interesting to watch such early docs because the compulsion to make things cinematic is still there  So while it doesn t always seem authentic  it does feel socially conscious  In fact  the whole film feels socially conscious   Paid Love  is a series of testimonials from prostitutes about their day to day struggle and personal histories  It s trying its best to be sincere  but the interviewer behind the camera can t help but offer condescending life advice to the women   Attempted Suicide  directed by Michelangelo Antonioni  focuses on exactly that  He interviews a series of women about their reasons for doing it and whether they re happy to still be alive  It s compelling and honest  and you can see the director s sensibilities at work  Dino Risi directs  3 Hours of Paradise  and it s a big pretty piece of nothing  Teenagers dancing  having cute and funny romantic interactions  boys getting slapped  shot down  wallflowers  It s just a beautifully choreographed yet overlong slice of life with no story or character to latch onto Fellini s  Marriage Agency  is dynamite  The director was already highly acclaimed with I Vitelloni  His craftsmanship blows everything else out of the water in terms of visual style  It s a strange and somewhat surreal story stuck in the middle of some very grounded shorts  But even with Fellini setting the world on fire  Francesco Maselli sweeps in with  Story of Caterina  to take the prize  This is a perfect slice of Italian Neo realism  It shows the daily trials a woman trying to take care of her infant son  It goes deep into the details of her toil and shows exactly why this life is so fucking hard  It s gut punch cinema and I love it But let s end on a happy note I guess  Yeah let s play some dance music and follow hot women around  Zoom in on their tits  Show their hips shake  Show all the other passers by gawking at them  That s all  Italians Stare  is  It s weird  It gets worse when a creepy mouth breather follows a girl all the way to her hotel  She goes in and he lingers outside until finally giving up  That s how our exceedingly empathetic slice of life anthology ends  a pervert disappointedly not getting to grope a chick today and wandering off to a  womp womp  sound  That shit ain t cute  Love in the City does not stick the landing ,3.5,Xebeche
31293,Love in the City,1953, Love in the City fails as a one off spectacle that s forged by seven of Italy s most celebrated directors collaborating on the same project The ideas are there  but the execution is messy and uninspired ,2.0,Jordan James Brooks ü§†
31293,Love in the City,1953, If I could  I d do it again  but this time I want to die One of the better anthology pieces I ve ever seen because of the way it meshes into one  Each piece is distinct but works towards the grander idea of finding as experiencing love in a big city  My favorite segment was  Michelangelo Antonioni s though Fellini s is right up there That being said the transition from story it story is rough and just as you re adjusted it switches  It s wonderful but has issues most anthologies do  mostly the weaker segments being  very  weak  Still worth the watch Would Recommend ,,Hayden Welch
31293,Love in the City,1953, Cuando el mundo y el ser humano pod an ser pensados a trav s del cine  Cuando en cada plano se jugaba una cuesti n moral  el peso de las ideas  la dignidad humana  Aunque no soy mucho de pel culas epis dicas  esta funciona como compendio de la idea del neorrealismo en el cine  y s lo el  ltimo segmento  el brillante ejercicio de montaje de Alberto Lattuada para desenmascarar una sociedad italiana movida por la cultura de la violaci n  parece desentonar un poco en el conjunto Las dos primeras partes  las de Lizzani y Antonioni  consisten en entrevistas a sus protagonistas  Las primeras  prostitutas que se mueven en la noche  como apartadas del mundo real  las segundas  supervivientes de suicidios que recrean sus experiencias  Antonioni los reune en un espacio abstracto  una gran habitaci n flanqueada por grandes s banas blancas que podr an ser las pantallas de un cine  y de los testimonios se salta a una reelaboraci n ficcionada de sus suicidios La m s hermosa de todas las pel culas es la de Dino Risi  que se limita a ser una descripci n minuciosa de un momento de vida en un sal n de baile al que acuden j venes y no tan j venes en busca del amor  o simplemente una v a de escape al mundo opresivo que reflejaban los dos episodios previos  Risi muestra simplemente los cuerpos bailando  los rostros mirando con miedo y deseo  los tiempos muertos en silencio  esperando a una nueva canci n  a una nueva oportunidad para encontrar otro ser solitario al que unirse durante unos minutos  Sin contexto  sin historia  sin gui n ni desarrollo argumental  el cineasta consigue transmitir desesperaci n en la belleza  o viceversa  No hace falta nada m s que una c mara en el lugar adecuado  a la altura necesaria y el tiempo exacto Fellini plantea la pel cula m s cl sica del conjunto  La historia de un hombre que investiga los negocios de las agencias matrimoniales  Se inventa la historia de un hombre monstruoso que busca una mujer que le acompa e en una vida de sufrimiento  La candidata aparece  y resulta ser un  ngel  dispuesta a todo por tener una vida  incluso amar y dar cari o a ese ficticio hombre lobo  Camino a conocer a ese hombre que no existe  el protagonista y la mujer hablan frente a un paisaje yermo  la inmensidad del espacio choca con los cuerpos de  l y de ella sentados  en una imagen t pica del neorrealismo  Finalmente  el protagonista le dice que no es la elegida y regresan a la ciudad  Uno de los grandes logros del neorrealismo fue el de enmarcar un anecd tico drama individual en el fundamental devenir de una tragedia colectiva  sabiendo medir las diferencias entre la intimidad de ese individuo y su valor como imagen de toda una sociedad  algo que se ha trasladado hasta hoy  pero de forma mucho menos afortunada  por la falta de altura moral y de compromiso de los cineastas a trav s de la c mara Respecto a esto  ltimo  es imposible no acordarse  viendo la bell sima Storia di Caterina de Francesco Maselli  en que un a o antes los italianos  y concretamente el Festival de Venecia  descubrieron a Kenji Mizoguchi  Caterina  la joven protagonista del film  sobrevive a un intento de suicidio  a la violaci n y al parto de un hijo ileg timo  al que no puede alimentar  Sin trabajo y sin amigos  lo abandona y es juzgada por la sociedad  pero nunca por la c mara  Maselli se mantiene en un emocionado silencio y encuentra en los planos secuencia de su c mara la manera de expresar el debate moral de la protagonista  Cuando consigue que le presten cien liras  no se le ocurre otra cosa que gastarlas en unas cerezas  Entonces la vemos comiendo las cerezas con la cabeza gacha mientras la c mara la sigue en un travelling lateral  mientras en segundo t rmino vemos el tr fico y la vida continuando en Roma  ajeno a esa mujer desesperada y sin futuro  Al igual que en Saikaku ichidai onna  de Mizoguchi  por mucho que Caterina cometa actos que  en una mirada fr a y descontextualizada  puedan resultar criminales  jam s lo son  Y es el cine el que convierte su mirada y sus gestos de resistencia en algo hermoso  La continuidad dram tica  la forma de engrandecer su rostro y su cuerpo  de privilegiarla sobre todo lo dem s es la grandeza de esta pel cula extraordinaria De ah  que sea curioso el contraste con la pel cula de Lattuada  En ella vemos a mujeres por la calle y a hombres que se giran para mirarlas  En ocasiones  vemos a las mujeres sentadas o paradas en medio de la calle  planos que se intercalan con primeros planos de hombres  mir ndolas lascivamente  En otras ocasiones  las mujeres pasean mientras la c mara las sigue en travelling  mientras los hombres que se cruzan la miran con o sin pudor  Lo fascinante de la pel cula es c mo Lattuada segmenta los movimientos de las mujeres y los gestos de los hombres de una forma casi conceptual  pareciendo por momentos una pel cula sovi tica  o el ejemplo m s directo  Rear Window  de Alfred Hitchcock  La m sica rimbombante parece convertirlo todo en una broma macabra  pero creo que no es m s que una forma de ocultar  de tapar  el objetivo real  la condena de la mujer en un mundo dominado por la mirada masculina  algo que  a adido a los anteriores episodios  cobra much sima fuerza Compendio de los logros del cine italiano de aquel tiempo  Amore in citt  quiz s no tenga el nombre ni la fama de otros films colectivos  pero para mi es de los que m s me ha impresionado  Si alguien quiere entender lo que fue el neorrealismo y su importancia fundamental para la historia del cine  y del siglo XX  seguramente  sta y Pais  sean las dos mejores pel culas  junto a Las mujeres de Messina de Elio Vittorini  Si Pais  comenzaba con el final de la guerra que destruy  Italia  junto a los falsos sue os de grandeza del estado fascista  Amore in citt  aparece justo cuando el nihilismo burgu s del gran crecimiento italiano gracias al plan Marshall lo empezaba a invadir todo  Entre una y otra  uno de los momentos de mayor esplendor del cine en uno de los momentos m s terribles del siglo XX europeo ,5.0,migblah

45395,The Blacksheep Affair,1998, Shot on location in Budapest  The Blacksheep Affair brings some exhilarating action to the screen  both in its raw and fantastical kung fu mayhem  as well as in its ballistic bullet brawls The film s main weakness is that it drifts off course with the whole Tammy subplot to give the characters some depth  Still  it didn t bother me that much personally as the rest of the film is slick Hong Kong action cinema at its kinetic best  with a cool Vincent Zhao at its center  Especially that final martial arts showdown hits the sweet spot ,3.5,Thor

45395,The Blacksheep Affair,1998, It is always good to geta Vincent Zhao showcase and The Blacksheep Affair is a very solid one  Whatever else  one cal always count on Zhao to look good while kicking people around  The Blacksheep Affair was developed for Jet Li  Zhao was  guy you get when Li is not available  for most of the 90s  so that probably explain Shu Qi be around as the romantic interest and the movie mix of ambition and not quite enough budget  It is a little clean to quite pull off its bigger excesses  There s some strong action choreography and the over the top third action makes up for some of the rougher spy plotting to get there ,3.0,Filipe Furtado

45395,The Blacksheep Affair,1998, Shot on location in Budapest  The Blacksheep Affair brings some exhilarating action to the screen  both in its raw and fantastical kung fu mayhem  as well as in its ballistic bullet brawls The film s main weakness is that it drifts off course with the whole Tammy subplot to give the characters some depth  Still  it didn t bother me that much personally as the rest of the film is slick Hong Kong action cinema at its kinetic best  with a cool Vincent Zhao at its center  Especially that final martial arts showdown hits the sweet spot ,3.5,Thor
45395,The Blacksheep Affair,1998, A Chinese cop is transferred to a fictional eastern European country where he crosses paths with a Japanese terrorist   Action filled and criminally nonsensical  The movie featured some fine post Woo Hong Kong style firearms overkill  like when the hero shoots an assassin out of a tree  and as the bad guy falls in slow motion the hero shoots him 22 more times before he hits the ground  I counted  But the martial arts work was the most impressive Hong Kong filmmakers really had fight scenes down to a science by the late 90s  and even the wirework was mostly tolerable  But movie s plot is utterly incomprehensible  in addition to having some dodgy politics  the Tiananmen Square massacre is described as just a  misunderstanding between the Chinese government and its people  and there is the worst non comic relief character I ve ever seen in a movie  an ex girlfriend of the hero whose presence in the movie is totally unjustified within the story and who serves only to blunder into dangerous situations and scream and cry and  o     o pu      p ll  s   s u  p l   u n  os s  I  Worth watching for the action sequences ,3.0,Ed K√ºpfer

45395,The Blacksheep Affair,1998, The exterior action scenes look like they belong in a Gary Daniels DTV action movie called City of Death or something  not sure how much of that is owing to it being shot on location in Budapest  There s just something off about it  The interior action scenes are terrific  lots of crazy wire work and this kinetic editing where it seems they use three alternate takes instead of settling on one take Very mixed bag ,2.5,Rutledal
45395,The Blacksheep Affair,1998, Unique in its setting and content  Haven t seen any other Hong Kong movies take place in a fictional Iron Curtain country  Also has the real life terrorist organization behind the Tokyo subway gas attacks as antagonists  Oh yeah and they talk about Tiananmen Square  Feel like they were trying to punch up a weight class with all the hot button topics they included  The story is pretty whatever would have made a perfect FPS game on N64 I gotta say  however  it featured some very good action scenes  The final fight in particular was great  Maybe I should be more lenient on the score since this is more than serviceable is scratching that action movie itch ,3.0,JamesPopinski

12629,Live Wire,1992, Ever wondered what the film career of Pierce Brosnan was like before his 1995 breakthrough as James Bond in Goldeneye  Well in addition to several other B action flicks you ve never heard of  Live Wire is more or less the answer to that question  a mind numblingly idiotic but explosive  literally  terrorist thriller that is at least entertaining as it is brainless Get this shit for a premise  A series of bizarre deaths are occurring around Washington D C  in which U S  senators are exploding due to some chemically enhanced water   which causes it s consumers to spontaneously combust  all the work of a sinister political plot led by terrorist Mikhail Rashid  Naturally  the feds get on the scene with the help of bomb expert Danny O  Neill  Brosnan  who has to figure out the weird science behind the deaths  all while with the knowledge that a local senator  Ron Silver  is banging his wife The opening text regarding international terrorism  and America s immunity to it pre 9 11  gives off the idea that this film was aiming to be taken seriously  but that more or less goes completely out the window within the first few minutes  Highlights like a bomb solving robot named  Madonna  a mook being blown to pieces in clown makeup and a mix of bad accents from both the hero and villains alike make this thing a great deal of comedy value from start to finish  Even if that wasn t the intention  you ve got to at least admire the filmmakers for being so devoted to such a silly idea Pierce as usual handles himself well during action scenes  particularly during a booby trapped climax for the ages  However  his faux American accent on the other hand is laughably awkward  in which you can clearly hear at points where his inner Irish is attempting to break out  What I found even more hilarious was the main terrorist villain played by Ben Cross  who chews the scenery with sinister phone calls  mostly towards his eventual victims  and over aggressive threats like  I ll cut your balls off Like a lot of similar movies of the genre from this time period  this one has pretty much faded into complete obscurity since it s release  However  if you re a fan of cheesy action films from the 80s and 90s  I highly doubt you d regret spending your time with this one  Is it stupid beyond belief  You bet  but it s still fun as hell to watch regardless  so from that standpoint I can t really complain 6 5 10,3.0,üéÑGe‚ùÑÔ∏èff TüéÑ

12629,Live Wire,1992, Ever wondered what the film career of Pierce Brosnan was like before his 1995 breakthrough as James Bond in Goldeneye  Well in addition to several other B action flicks you ve never heard of  Live Wire is more or less the answer to that question  a mind numblingly idiotic but explosive  literally  terrorist thriller that is at least entertaining as it is brainless Get this shit for a premise  A series of bizarre deaths are occurring around Washington D C  in which U S  senators are exploding due to some chemically enhanced water   which causes it s consumers to spontaneously combust  all the work of a sinister political plot led by terrorist Mikhail Rashid  Naturally  the feds get on the scene with the help of bomb expert Danny O  Neill  Brosnan  who has to figure out the weird science behind the deaths  all while with the knowledge that a local senator  Ron Silver  is banging his wife The opening text regarding international terrorism  and America s immunity to it pre 9 11  gives off the idea that this film was aiming to be taken seriously  but that more or less goes completely out the window within the first few minutes  Highlights like a bomb solving robot named  Madonna  a mook being blown to pieces in clown makeup and a mix of bad accents from both the hero and villains alike make this thing a great deal of comedy value from start to finish  Even if that wasn t the intention  you ve got to at least admire the filmmakers for being so devoted to such a silly idea Pierce as usual handles himself well during action scenes  particularly during a booby trapped climax for the ages  However  his faux American accent on the other hand is laughably awkward  in which you can clearly hear at points where his inner Irish is attempting to break out  What I found even more hilarious was the main terrorist villain played by Ben Cross  who chews the scenery with sinister phone calls  mostly towards his eventual victims  and over aggressive threats like  I ll cut your balls off Like a lot of similar movies of the genre from this time period  this one has pretty much faded into complete obscurity since it s release  However  if you re a fan of cheesy action films from the 80s and 90s  I highly doubt you d regret spending your time with this one  Is it stupid beyond belief  You bet  but it s still fun as hell to watch regardless  so from that standpoint I can t really complain 6 5 10,3.0,üéÑGe‚ùÑÔ∏èff TüéÑ

44134,Barnacle Bill,1957, Barnacle Bill  as it s called in the UK  is one of the less well known Ealing comedies  Alec Guinness stars as a Royal Navy captain with 400 years of seafaring ancestors  but to his shame he is afflicted with severe seasickness and has had to spend his career on dry land  teaching at naval college  On retirement he buys a seaside pier at a knockdown price  it turns out that the local resort is plagued by a particularly prudish set of town councillors and gangs of rebellious rock  n  roll teenagers  The latter scenario has potential for a Dead Poet s Society us and them cliche but this film is smarter and wittier than to allow anything like that to happen  I love Ealing comedies  but Barnacle Bill made me actually laugh more than any of the others I ve seen  with a variety of puns verbal and sometimes visual  and intricate satire of bureaucracy  one facet of which was familar from another of the studio s productions Captain Ambrose is a very nicely drawn character with aspects that are ridiculous and some likeable  a man it s possible to laugh both at and with by turns  I found a lot to identify with in him  The motion sickness is the obvious bit  I also winced as well as laughed at some of the views and scenes that made him queasy  and if this isn t a better film about this problem than Woman on Top I should put a hat on to boil now  But in a comedy character especially his mixture of pomposity and open mindedness is realistic and rare  walking into a new workplace immediately thinking of what needs to be changed to better methods he s already seen  yet also very welcoming of other people s ideas at times  Not everyone will like the character quite so much  of course  and comedy is one of the most subjective genres  as has already been said on the site today  but Barnacle Bill is as funny and as charming a film as any I ve seen from Ealing and seems unjustly neglected Incidentally  why was it in the past that great actors played multiple roles in the same film  as Guinness here plays several of Ambrose s ancestors  and as Peter Sellers did several times elsewhere    yet these days the ones who do so are Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler missed 5 minutes between 1h02  1h07 despite valiant efforts to combat a faulty rental disc ,4.5,Antonomasia

44134,Barnacle Bill,1957, Is this one of the least regarded Ealing comedies  It seems so  and I read that Guinness himself wasn t a fan of it either  but I found it to be very amiable and sweet  Guinness plays a navy devotee with no sea legs who buys a seaside pier and runs it like a military operation  including registering it as a ship to avoid being shut down  It s certainly a comedy that even now feels out of time   it shoves in some 50s youths to feel  modern   Jackie Collins plays one of them  but the actual plot and old timeyness of it feels like it s decades late to the party  I can imagine this desperately missing the zeitgeist in 1957 Guinness embodies a sort of English navy spirit that doesn t really seem to have ideology or values  indeed he is literally trying to bring gambling and alcohol to a quiet seafront  but what he does embody is the spirit of getting stuff done and doing so with a stiff upper lip  An anti establishment establishment figure  treated as if being aloof and desperately outdated has gone full circle and become cool again  English seaside locations did and still do tend to be dilapidated places  sad relics of their Victorian heyday  so its great to see a run down pier get its moment in the sun ,3.0,Alex V

44134,Barnacle Bill,1957, Charles Frend directs this Ealing comedy in which a seasick sea captain commands an amusement pier despite local opposition  Starring Alec Guinness  Harry Locke  Frederick Piper and Donald Pleasence  After being privileged by the British government for rescuing the H M S  Arabella  Captain William Horatio Ambrose  Alec Guinness  re counts the proper adventure of the liberation to a reporter  Harry Locke  Although inclined from a long line of sea going skippers with a standing for braveness  William acknowledges to an individual  congenital clandestine that weakens the family custom  Further  while sozzled  William specifics that the redemption of the Arabella was not precisely a maritime scrap  Alec Guinness gives a good performance in his role as William Horatio Ambrose  the unsuccessful navy officer who tells us what actually happened to the reporter who was involved  Although Guinness is decent here  he will definitely be more remembered for his part in David Lean s multi Oscar winning Second World War classic drama The Bridge on the River Kwai  with Guinness taking home one of the film s seven Academy Awards  for Best Actor  Elsewhere  Harry Locke is fine as the reporter involved  while Frederick Piper and Donald Pleasance are respectable as a barman and a cashier  and Irene Browne and Maurice Denham are OK as Mrs  Barrington and Crowley  The direction from Frend is good because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout  while also keeping a pleasant atmosphere happening as well  The script is written to a decent standard by T E B  Clarke as he makes the movie good to follow and creates humorous moments too  But you can still understand what is happening  because the narrative is definitely there  The camera stands out best in terms of the technical aspects  because this makes very good use of the locations and also captures the funny moments well  which get the edge of the seat status Although I would not describe this Ealing comedy as a classic   compared to The Ladykillers for example   Barnacle Bill is still a relaxing and enjoyable experience  Overall  it isn t a classic  but Barnacle Bill is an enjoyable Ealing comedy  thanks to the good performances  direction  funny script and pleasant atmosphere ,3.0,Luke Thorne
44134,Barnacle Bill,1957, A Navy man who suffers from chronic seasickness buys a run down pier with the idea that he can run it like a ship and finally get the command of which he has always dreamed Unfortunately the local council have other ideas  They want to demolish the pier to make way for a new development  so the captain is forced to come up with a way by which he can rid himself of land bound jurisdiction This is unquestionably the hidden gem of the Ealing Comedies  while by no means on a par with the likes of The Ladykillers  The Lavender Hill Mob et al  this sits very comfortably with the second tier films in that rough grouping  with the likes of The Titfield Thunderbolt And it is with that film that Barnacle Bill has much in common  with its theme of tradition vs the onward march of progress  although the solution to the Captain s problems here lies in a kind of innovation which is itself progress There s no denying that the film lacks that edge which elevates the best of the studio s output  although there are digs at the petty bureaucracy and self interest which bedevil local government  but this is a gentle delight  who s only crime is not to be quite as good as some of the greatest comedies ever made ,3.5,Paul D

44134,Barnacle Bill,1957, Barnacle Bill  as it s called in the UK  is one of the less well known Ealing comedies  Alec Guinness stars as a Royal Navy captain with 400 years of seafaring ancestors  but to his shame he is afflicted with severe seasickness and has had to spend his career on dry land  teaching at naval college  On retirement he buys a seaside pier at a knockdown price  it turns out that the local resort is plagued by a particularly prudish set of town councillors and gangs of rebellious rock  n  roll teenagers  The latter scenario has potential for a Dead Poet s Society us and them cliche but this film is smarter and wittier than to allow anything like that to happen  I love Ealing comedies  but Barnacle Bill made me actually laugh more than any of the others I ve seen  with a variety of puns verbal and sometimes visual  and intricate satire of bureaucracy  one facet of which was familar from another of the studio s productions Captain Ambrose is a very nicely drawn character with aspects that are ridiculous and some likeable  a man it s possible to laugh both at and with by turns  I found a lot to identify with in him  The motion sickness is the obvious bit  I also winced as well as laughed at some of the views and scenes that made him queasy  and if this isn t a better film about this problem than Woman on Top I should put a hat on to boil now  But in a comedy character especially his mixture of pomposity and open mindedness is realistic and rare  walking into a new workplace immediately thinking of what needs to be changed to better methods he s already seen  yet also very welcoming of other people s ideas at times  Not everyone will like the character quite so much  of course  and comedy is one of the most subjective genres  as has already been said on the site today  but Barnacle Bill is as funny and as charming a film as any I ve seen from Ealing and seems unjustly neglected Incidentally  why was it in the past that great actors played multiple roles in the same film  as Guinness here plays several of Ambrose s ancestors  and as Peter Sellers did several times elsewhere    yet these days the ones who do so are Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler missed 5 minutes between 1h02  1h07 despite valiant efforts to combat a faulty rental disc ,4.5,Antonomasia

44134,Barnacle Bill,1957, Is this one of the least regarded Ealing comedies  It seems so  and I read that Guinness himself wasn t a fan of it either  but I found it to be very amiable and sweet  Guinness plays a navy devotee with no sea legs who buys a seaside pier and runs it like a military operation  including registering it as a ship to avoid being shut down  It s certainly a comedy that even now feels out of time   it shoves in some 50s youths to feel  modern   Jackie Collins plays one of them  but the actual plot and old timeyness of it feels like it s decades late to the party  I can imagine this desperately missing the zeitgeist in 1957 Guinness embodies a sort of English navy spirit that doesn t really seem to have ideology or values  indeed he is literally trying to bring gambling and alcohol to a quiet seafront  but what he does embody is the spirit of getting stuff done and doing so with a stiff upper lip  An anti establishment establishment figure  treated as if being aloof and desperately outdated has gone full circle and become cool again  English seaside locations did and still do tend to be dilapidated places  sad relics of their Victorian heyday  so its great to see a run down pier get its moment in the sun ,3.0,Alex V
44134,Barnacle Bill,1957, From Ealing Studios comes  All At Sea  a 1957 film starring Alec Guinness and a cast that includes names which were or became familiar names familiar faces in British film and theatre productions  and in one case  books  Irene Browne  Maurice Denham  Lionel Jeffries  Joan Hickson  George Rose  Jackie Collins  Donald Pleasence  and Eric Pohlmann  most of these actors in small roles Captain Ambrose comes from a long line of sailors who had sketchy histories  but he himself can t get on the water because of seasickness After the war  he buys an amusement pier in a resort town  which the town council wants to tear down  However  he is too clever for them  He has it registered as a ship  thus making it impossible for them to get rid of it He is able to make the pier profitable and becomes friends with the woman  Irene Browne  who has rental huts on the beach that are about to become displaced by the grand plans of the council  And they haven t given up yet Amusing film with Alec Guinness playing Captain Ambrose   and like most great actors  he does the part seriously  which makes it funnier  He carries the film as the other actors have small roles  Browne s is a little bigger and she is wonderful as first an enemy of the captain and then as a warm friend The final scenes are excellent  as Ambrose s heritage comes into play  Really fine film ,4.0,Beautifulkiller
44134,Barnacle Bill,1957, Charles Frend directs this Ealing comedy in which a seasick sea captain commands an amusement pier despite local opposition  Starring Alec Guinness  Harry Locke  Frederick Piper and Donald Pleasence  After being privileged by the British government for rescuing the H M S  Arabella  Captain William Horatio Ambrose  Alec Guinness  re counts the proper adventure of the liberation to a reporter  Harry Locke  Although inclined from a long line of sea going skippers with a standing for braveness  William acknowledges to an individual  congenital clandestine that weakens the family custom  Further  while sozzled  William specifics that the redemption of the Arabella was not precisely a maritime scrap  Alec Guinness gives a good performance in his role as William Horatio Ambrose  the unsuccessful navy officer who tells us what actually happened to the reporter who was involved  Although Guinness is decent here  he will definitely be more remembered for his part in David Lean s multi Oscar winning Second World War classic drama The Bridge on the River Kwai  with Guinness taking home one of the film s seven Academy Awards  for Best Actor  Elsewhere  Harry Locke is fine as the reporter involved  while Frederick Piper and Donald Pleasance are respectable as a barman and a cashier  and Irene Browne and Maurice Denham are OK as Mrs  Barrington and Crowley  The direction from Frend is good because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout  while also keeping a pleasant atmosphere happening as well  The script is written to a decent standard by T E B  Clarke as he makes the movie good to follow and creates humorous moments too  But you can still understand what is happening  because the narrative is definitely there  The camera stands out best in terms of the technical aspects  because this makes very good use of the locations and also captures the funny moments well  which get the edge of the seat status Although I would not describe this Ealing comedy as a classic   compared to The Ladykillers for example   Barnacle Bill is still a relaxing and enjoyable experience  Overall  it isn t a classic  but Barnacle Bill is an enjoyable Ealing comedy  thanks to the good performances  direction  funny script and pleasant atmosphere ,3.0,Luke Thorne
44134,Barnacle Bill,1957, A Navy man who suffers from chronic seasickness buys a run down pier with the idea that he can run it like a ship and finally get the command of which he has always dreamed Unfortunately the local council have other ideas  They want to demolish the pier to make way for a new development  so the captain is forced to come up with a way by which he can rid himself of land bound jurisdiction This is unquestionably the hidden gem of the Ealing Comedies  while by no means on a par with the likes of The Ladykillers  The Lavender Hill Mob et al  this sits very comfortably with the second tier films in that rough grouping  with the likes of The Titfield Thunderbolt And it is with that film that Barnacle Bill has much in common  with its theme of tradition vs the onward march of progress  although the solution to the Captain s problems here lies in a kind of innovation which is itself progress There s no denying that the film lacks that edge which elevates the best of the studio s output  although there are digs at the petty bureaucracy and self interest which bedevil local government  but this is a gentle delight  who s only crime is not to be quite as good as some of the greatest comedies ever made ,3.5,Paul D
44134,Barnacle Bill,1957, Week 03 of the Letterboxd Season Challenge 2016 2017 Ealing Studios WeekI was planning on watching Whiskey Galore  for this week  and also to not watch it two weeks late  but the disc didn t arrive in time and then I went on a retreat for a week  I then saw that UK Gold was airing a bunch of Ealing Studios Films but the only one they were showing that I hadn t already seen was this one so here we are As a Brit I have a soft spot for British cinema  I love the gritty realism and the lack of budget and the generally high standard of acting  As a Brit I ve also seen quite a few Ealing Studios films mostly because my Grandad was a big fan and had the dvd boxset  Unfortunately my love of British films doesn t really extend to these comedies  possibly for the same reason why I ve never got any of those  classic  British sitcoms like Dad s Army  With the exception of Kind Hearts and Coronets  which I can t help but enjoy for Alec Guinness alone  I ve found them all to be very boring  Barnacle Bill is a supposedly lesser Ealing Comedy but I find it very hard to distinguish between this and all the others  Alec Guinness is very good as he always is  otherwise I just don t get it ,1.5,Katrina

5065,Carry On Cowboy,1965, The Rumpo Kid  Sid James  has taken control of the once peaceful Stodge City and killed its sheriff   The local mayor  Judge Burke  Kenneth Williams  sends an urgent message to the state capital at the very moment that Marshall P  Knutt  Jim Dale  is looking for a job The problem is that Knutt is not a peace officer  he s a sanitation engineer first class with Marshall for a first name  You can see how confusion would arise  although given that he s from Chipping Sodbury you d think the English accent would raise one or two questions I would love to know what our American cousins think of the accent work going on here  to my ear it is  shall we say variable  but for the most part tolerable  Williams certainly goes at it full title  I can imagine that to natives of the Americas the voice work grinds on their ears in the same way that Dick Van Dyke does in Mary Poppins  but after all this is a comedy so no one s meant to be taking the acting seriously The one exception is Charles Hawtry  playing the local Indian chief  Big Heap  who simply doesn t bother at all  while his son Little Heap  Bernard Bresslaw  adds  um  to the end of every other word in true Native American fashion  Hawtry speaks perfect English  a fact which is barely referenced  It s actually a quite brilliant move which subverts expectations and pretty much diffuses the problematic issue of casting a white man in the role  Not that anyone would have been at all bothered by that then  and if you really want to be offended take a look at Up the Jungle Like the accents no one is going to be in the slightest bit convinced by the scenery which will look familiar only to fans of Hammer Horror At its heart this is of course another take on High Noon with Marsh doing what a man s got to do  which is to do the right thing and to win the heart of Angela Douglas  It is a reference which the film freely acknowledges although it perhaps owes as much to another British Comedy Western  The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw  while there are moments where you are reminded of Blazing Saddles  although it might be a bit of a stretch to suggest that this film influenced Mel Brooks ,3.5,Paul D

5065,Carry On Cowboy,1965, The Rumpo Kid  Sid James  has taken control of the once peaceful Stodge City and killed its sheriff   The local mayor  Judge Burke  Kenneth Williams  sends an urgent message to the state capital at the very moment that Marshall P  Knutt  Jim Dale  is looking for a job The problem is that Knutt is not a peace officer  he s a sanitation engineer first class with Marshall for a first name  You can see how confusion would arise  although given that he s from Chipping Sodbury you d think the English accent would raise one or two questions I would love to know what our American cousins think of the accent work going on here  to my ear it is  shall we say variable  but for the most part tolerable  Williams certainly goes at it full title  I can imagine that to natives of the Americas the voice work grinds on their ears in the same way that Dick Van Dyke does in Mary Poppins  but after all this is a comedy so no one s meant to be taking the acting seriously The one exception is Charles Hawtry  playing the local Indian chief  Big Heap  who simply doesn t bother at all  while his son Little Heap  Bernard Bresslaw  adds  um  to the end of every other word in true Native American fashion  Hawtry speaks perfect English  a fact which is barely referenced  It s actually a quite brilliant move which subverts expectations and pretty much diffuses the problematic issue of casting a white man in the role  Not that anyone would have been at all bothered by that then  and if you really want to be offended take a look at Up the Jungle Like the accents no one is going to be in the slightest bit convinced by the scenery which will look familiar only to fans of Hammer Horror At its heart this is of course another take on High Noon with Marsh doing what a man s got to do  which is to do the right thing and to win the heart of Angela Douglas  It is a reference which the film freely acknowledges although it perhaps owes as much to another British Comedy Western  The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw  while there are moments where you are reminded of Blazing Saddles  although it might be a bit of a stretch to suggest that this film influenced Mel Brooks ,3.5,Paul D

5065,Carry On Cowboy,1965, Another favourite of mine in the Carry On series as I quite enjoyed the old style westerns when I was a kid  so watching my favourite comedy troupe send them up was always fun for me back then and it remains so now  even as the movie s aged to the point where folk could rightly levy some issues at the picture by modern morality standards one supposes  but I don t put any stock in left leaning people criticizing older movies  and neither should you or anyone for that matter  Sid James made classlessness a class act in the Carry On movies didn t he though  Top lad ,3.0,Jedidiah Rose

116733,The Hunchedback Horse,1947, A lovely Russian animated film telling the story of a fairy tale that is unfamilar to the Western world  but one that is full of magic and adventure  A little boy named Ivan meets a magical horse who gifts him another magical companion pony and two mighty steeds  When a tsar purchases the two steeds  his horsemaster is unable to control them  so he employs Ivan in his place  But the jealous horsemaster keeps whispering in the tsar s ear that Ivan boastfully claims he can capture wondrous  magical creatures for the tsar s collection  just so he can watch Ivan fail and be executed  So  Ivan goes on a series of quests with the aid of his magical pony to please the tsar and stay in his good graces   The animation is charming  very reminiscent of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  which I m sure was the goal  considering the time period  And the music is in the same operetta mode  so it may not be pleasant for most modern listeners  but it was music to my ears  The story can get a little frustrating  since the villains are particularly loathsome and task the poor child with impossible demands  but rest assured that all works out for the best in the end  If you want to watch  make sure you don t confuse this with the 1975 remake by the same director  They re almost identical films style wise  but the 1975 version has an English dub  This one had rhyming subtitles that were not typed out properly  but it was still pretty easy to follow    Fanimation   Every Animated Film I ve Seen,4.0,Michael Shawn

116733,The Hunchedback Horse,1947, The Little Humpbacked Horse  1947     The Little Humpbacked Horse is based on a folk tale written in verse by Pyotr Yershov in the 1830s  although some now dispute his authorship  This almost one hour long animation tells of Ivan the Fool  a very common character in Slavic folklore  who is gifted with two beautiful horses and one little humpbacked horse that becomes his friend  Ivan and the horse s adventures begin when Ivan is appointed to be the head of Tsar s stables  He is tasked by the Tsar to do the seemingly impossible tasks  such as procuring very rare animals and people  and  amazingly  Ivan does so with ease because the hunchback horse helps him  His adversary becomes the Tsar s ex advisory man The animation has a lot to tell about the value of friendship and the dangers of avarice  The presentation of two wonder horses gifted to Ivan  as well the Fire Birds  is stunning  and the brilliant music and the final task set by the Tsar to Ivan are very memorable ,4.0,Diana
116733,The Hunchedback Horse,1947, ANIMATION CHALLENGE a movie about a king his bucket list  a weird donkey and a very annoying protagonist Its still classic 40s animation so I can complain that much,2.5,VALüåø
116733,The Hunchedback Horse,1947, A phenomenally animated relic from the 1940 s   The Hunchedback Horse  is fairly loose in its story  but it is a feast to the eyes with every frame looking like it was crafted with painstaking effort This is a very good movie for the time it was released  Obviously  I m not the best at covering films from this long ago as I will always be looking at it from a contemporary perspective  but this unique Russian film  The Hunchedback Horse  still holds up  even if its story is a little lacking  For one  this film is just dripping with detail and fluidity  the animation was the main reason I wanted to see this so much and it sure did not disappoint  Animation from this era didn t have any shortcuts to streamline the process so animators would go all in with movement with no restrictions  and the sight is really something to behold  You d assume that animation from really early on would be primitive and dated but it s actually the opposite  this kind of free flowing movement for even the simplest of gestures is glorious to see  There s occasional jerkiness but the parts that look great REALLY look great  There are several scenes involving horses making complex maneuvers  I could only imagine the painstaking level of work it took to produce this  This kind of animation is what holds the story up  even when it is lacking in some areas  If there was any reason you should watch this as an animation fan  it would be because of the visuals And while the design of the main character is a bit uncanny at first  it is very fitting for his personality and to the film s credit the movie does a great job at making you root for him  His constant mistreatment by the king and the courtier make him very easy to sympathize with  especially when the problems that he gets into are of no fault of his own  The courtier and his numerous attempts to manipulate the king into thinking the protagonist made statements he never made makes him a very effective foil   you want to see him lose  which is exactly what a good traditional villain needs to do  And while it s very odd that the two brothers  despite their implied importance at the beginning have no bearing on the rest of the story  the bond between Konyok gorbunok and Ivan was sweet enough for you to care when one of them was in trouble  The hunchedback horse served as a good voice of reason whenever the main character got in trouble  but despite the main character being regarded by the movie as  a fool  he is actually a lot smarter than he first appears  even going so far as to attempt snatching a bird by dancing as one  Had his intelligence never been mentioned I wouldn t have even guessed that he was a  fool  at all given how little relevance it actually has to the rest of the story  If he is not an idiot  what does it mean when the two other brothers are described as being higher in intelligence than him  This aspect isn t touched upon either or explored  as mentioned before they are completely gone after the first 10 minutes  You would expect that those details of one being average intelligence and one being of high intelligence would be important considering how much it s emphasized but it just isn t   there is just no payoff at all  a very odd detail noted by the film that goes nowhere  I am looking at this from a very modern perspective so take this with a grain of salt  but I think even fairy tales that were released around and before this time still had satisfying payoffs to things that were established in the beginning  and that it wasn t all just completely random That being said  this film has a rhyming scheme and I think whoever subtitled this movie did a very good job at translating it into English despite the film is still very understandable whilst adhering to this restriction  It is still a very watchable film thanks to the visuals  and to this movie s credit it had a very strong conclusion that left me affirmed that this truly was a good movie  The tsar is a very entertaining threat to the hero  and the way things escalate towards the end made for a very satisfying conclusion  Not going to spoil anything  but things got particularly brutal   perhaps a child wouldn t think twice about it  but the implication of what happens is actually quite horrific  It s definitely a shock to say the least  but it was very poetic and fitting  A very solid end to an already engaging and exciting climax All things considered I still found this to be a very solid movie  When it comes to the story it feels weirdly sloppy and there are some things that seem like they would be developed on more but aren t  but the animation and visuals definitely hold this one up  As an animation relic  this one is pretty significant   and I think it s worth recognizing that America was not the only one making fantastic animation at this time  Walt Disney himself showed this film to his fellow artists and animators and for good reason  it s a shame that beyond the country it was made in most people do not know of  The Hunchedback Horse  This is a pretty fantastic film in terms of animation  as a film it s pretty good   The visuals are great  I love the music and even the duo as underdeveloped as they were are charming in their own right  This film is pretty good  and for that reason I m giving it a 6 10

20993,Brother 2,2000, The original Brother is not a movie that feels incomplete without a sequel  yet Brother 2 never feels unnecessary  It continues Danila s descent into crime and cynicism with the interesting dynamic of Russian x American interactions  The contention becomes most apparent by positing Danila s foolish brother as the representation of American hedonism and naivet  while Danila maintains his Russian sensibilities  The scale is much grander than the original  and it slightly suffers from being less focused  After the success of the original  I think they amped up the propaganda in this one lol  Nonetheless  it maintains a style and intrigue that keeps it entertaining  and Sergei Bodrov Jr  had amazing star power ,4.0,cammots
20993,Brother 2,2000, Brother 2 feels like an unnecessary sequel  It is bigger than the first film  with a larger budget  celebrity appearances  and foreign locations  It loses the power of the first Brother  moving away from a story of lost youth into something larger and more ridiculous  That said  Brother 2 still manages to explore the depths of the post Soviet world and the American Dream which capitalism supposedly promises  This isn t a film about the fringes of Russian society  but something more global  a world of greed  corruption  and ruthlessness  With its second half set in the USA Brother 2 becomes about the Russian diaspora and Russian identity in an era where people seemed lost  There are anti American and anti Ukrainian sentiments expressed by the characters  and the lead purchases weapons from a neo Nazi  revealing a culture leaning towards xenophobia and fascism  Though it s hard to determine how unhealthy the film s politics are  and what is merely observation rather than condemnation or praise  The Brother series is about a feeling of helplessness within Russia  which eventually transforms into nationalism and patriotism  A taxi driver references lost Russian lands  something apparently important even though it shouldn t affect his life  Brother 2 is an intriguing look at the situation in Russia in the 1990s  It examines a new form of gangster capitalism unearthed as a generation finds themselves uncertain in the world  However it lacks the realist grit of the first Brother and moves into more questionable territory with its observations  Its depiction of black Americans is a significant example which feels dated and reliant on stereotypes  Yet Brother 2 is an ambiguous film about bad characters and the rotten world around them  not a political treatise  It is made with a ferocious energy  overlaid with a constant stream of Russian pop and rock songs that make for a killer soundtrack  The violence is disturbing yet shot with a grim ecstasy that creates a perverse excitement  Brother 2 preserves the pulsating crime movie strengths of the first film  It lacks the focused execution and careful character work of Brother  but it does have some great moments and interesting ideas ,3.0,Darren Carver-Balsiger
20993,Brother 2,2000, Brother  was a film that did not need a sequel  But if you re going to do that  might as well be something like this  The russian wit and violence travel to the United States  functioning as both a critique and a compliment to the american people  More important than that  the great qualities of Danila as a protagonist are kept as he still is a badass that can differentiate right from wrong  Another cool film by one of the coolest russian directors  Also  Aleksey Balabanov knows how to film cars ,4.0,maneleeo

20993,Brother 2,2000,  What s your name  Marilyn  And in Russian  Dasha By and large  this feels like two different films with only the same characters and a few plot elements in common  A sequel to the 1997 Brother  Brother 2 once again follows Danilla as he first hangs out in Moscow and then later goes to the United States  The first half that takes in Moscow is the one that feels the most like a standard crime action flick  aside from the fact that the main character is having an affair with a pop star who s played by herself  This part of the film is also the most generic part and while it s still at least average  it s only when Danilla goes to Chicago that it truly picks up  Although it s got a few instances of shoe horned in obvious political commentary and less than stellar performances from more or less everybody in the American cast  it s pretty entertaining to watch the protagonist try to navigate through the United States as a complete outsider The sequel received a significantly higher budget than the first film  something which is definitely noticeable  the camera work is glossier and less  dirty  though there are still some weird hick ups and weird transition choices here and there  and I m not even going to talk about those Soviet style voice over translations  Partially because of this and also a change in atmosphere overall  the social realism elements are less pronounced in comparison to the first one and there is more focus on action and comedy  For the most part it works alright but overall I found the darker and more fluid tone of the prequel to be superior  Luckily  both Sergei Bodrov Jr s performance and the soundtrack  not counting the pop songs  are on the same level as before While it ultimately isn t quite on par with the first part in the duology  Brother 2 is still a pretty good sequel all in all 7 10,3.5,ComicTwerk4Sans

20993,Brother 2,2000, Seeing Russians attempt to make a Hollywood blockbuster makes for a unique watch  The entire thing has a real  Lets see how you like it  feel in regards to how American cinema portrays Russia and it s people and it s not afraid to highlight the more ugly parts of the country  I particularly enjoyed the scenes between Danila and the American truck driver The soundtrack slaps too  it s not hard to see why this unfortunately  and tragically  short lived series became such a touchstone in its home country ,4.0,COBRARocky

64316,Warriors Two,1978, It s possible  I suppose  that the reason that Sammo Hung very rarely allowed himself to be the hero of his films  even this early in his directorial career  when he s very obviously trying to make a name for himself  was for commercial reasons  Like he and or his producers felt that audiences wouldn t by him as a leading man  even in an action movie But I really don t think that s it  For his entire career  more than 50 years now  he s been dedicated to showing off other people  making his peers look good while playing in supporting roles or behind the camera  This a tremendously generous film  with Sammo allowing people like Casanova Wong  who doesn t have a tenth of Sammo s screen charism  or Beardy  sans beard  to steal the show  and giving great showcases for the film s villains  Fung Hak on and Lee Hoi sang in particular  but also just letting Dean Shek do whatever it is that Dean Shek thinks he s doing  There s even a killer scene early on for Lau Kar wing  Meanwhile for most of the movie Sammo plays comic relief  allowing himself to get beat up by everyone else  showing off his skills as the best partner in kung fu movie history  before finally giving us a glimpse of what he s capable of in the final twenty minutes or so I hadn t seen this since way back in the very first week of the Summer of Sammo  almost nine years ago now  I really liked this movie then  It s encouraging to learn I like it just as much now as I did then  all those movies ago ,4.0,Sean Gilman

64316,Warriors Two,1978, Love how small the scale of this early Sammo Hung film is   for all the great fighting on display  and nearly every action scene here is terrific  this is a story about a bank cashier and a dumpling vendor drawn into a small town dispute that escalates into murder  As usual with Sammo the gags are funny and the violence is just unnerving enough in the force of its presentation ,4.0,nrh
64316,Warriors Two,1978, One of Sammo s early chances to get behind the camera in the 70s and functionally a kung fu training   bloody revenge movie straight from the Lau Kar leung Shaw Brothers school of narrative structure and shooting style  Where Sammo s approach differs slightly is in sacrificing the more epic pageantry for the lean  athletic realization of pretty ridiculous and diverse choreography  There s only really one major fight that s expressly slapstick in the otherwise fairly gruesome and savage finale but you can really see his unique style starting to form when it needs to keep coming up with ways to switch up the nearly 30 minute long fight this ends on  Especially that big climax with the Mantis dude that is centered around Sammo strategically taking as many protective blows as possible instead of being on the offense  just a detail not many would come up with  I also really liked the cutting back to the training imagery during its practical use in the finale  the girl who briefly manages to keep standing despite being gutted by two swords and the fight with Leung Kar yan where he takes on like a dozen dudes with his foot gushing blood from the bear trap it s caught in  Ends on a great freeze frame gag as well ,4.0,Josh Lewis

9013,Midnight Run,1988, What s cool about Midnight Run is it s one of the best buddy cop movies to not have one of the leads play an actual cop at the time  Robert De Niro is the ex cop turned bounty hunter hired by Joey Pants to find mob accountant   bail jumper Charles Grodin  Not only is the mob chasing De Niro and Grodin  but the FBI is paying close attention too  Throw in another reckless renegade bounty hunter out to steal De Niro s bounty  and you know you re in for a wild ride Midnight Run works because of the natural chemistry between De Niro and Grodin  De Niro is the Raging Bull  but Grodin steals the show  He s neurotic and quirky  Every word he utters is hilarious  Every facial expression is priceless  The way these two play off each other is about as good as it gets when it comes to comedic timing and interaction The 80 s jazzy moody bluesy musical score is a near perfect fit  The people our duo interacts with makes Midnight Run exciting  hilarious and at times heartwarming  The dialogue is so right  De Niro averages a fuck a minute  The amount of cigarettes smoked would give the Marlboro Man and Joe Camel lung cancer  Dennis Farina  Yaphet Kotto and John Ashton all bring it in supporting roles  The only nitpicks are slight pacing issues at times and a couple of technical goofs  This is one of the most overlooked  underrated and well acted action   comedy   buddy cop   road trip movies I ve ever seen  Highly recommended ,4.0,Todd Gaines

102155,Hitler,1962, Watched because a dear friend of mine has a small part in it Not sure the world needed this odd and uneven movie psychoanalyzing Hitler  Interesting that it came out the same year as John Huston s movie about Freud  Intercuts scenes of Hitler obsessing over his niece and his late mother with actual archival footage  with an overemphasis on the former   Scenes about the Reichstag fire and Hitler invading Poland and France are dealt with in very short order with an occasional newsreel type voiceover None of the American actors playing Hitler s inner circle are convincing  except maybe the actor playing the ill fated Ernst R hm  As for Basehart himself  maybe I m too fond of the actor to see him as Hitler  Despite the mustache and all  he offers probably not the best Hitler portrayal but also probably not the worst  Not that I ever plan on watching more dramatized biopics like this one  Maybe someday I ll finally watch Downfall with another actor I love  Bruno Ganz  And not just that scene that s been memed to death ,2.0,sknolle
102155,Hitler,1962, This really is an oddball curio  with its relatively low budget forcing it to be played out completely in studio interiors  save for the odd deployment of ill matching stock footage taking care of little matters like the Nuremberg rallies  the invasion of half of Europe and the fall of Berlin  Hitler s entire mania is seen to be founded in an uncontrollable mother fixation  which frequently has him facing up to his impotence with her lookalikes embodied in both his niece  who he conveniently has bumped off  and Eva Braun  The psychosexual angle was probably quite daring for its time  but it is largely ineffective because it is all handled in such a cumbersome fashion  all sweaty side partings and anguished heads buried in hands and bosoms  There s an earnestness about it that unfortunately tends to elicit giggles on a regular basis  not least when the breezy narration sporadically remembers to kick in just to get viewers up to speed on the latest state of play in the Teutonic loon s rise and fall  A few familiar biographical landmarks are thrown in  and World War 2 is dealt with snappily in the last 30 minutes  right up to the wedding  suicide and immolation in the Berlin bunker  This is just before the narrator reminds us about what a terrible bloke he was and how his sort must never be allowed to prosper again etc  etc  While there is frequent recourse to anti Semitic ranting by the lead  the Holocaust itself is never mentioned at all  Tom Cruise haters will probably be delighted that the entire plot of  Valkyrie  is condensed into about five minutes in the latter stages ,,NeilyJ

102155,Hitler,1962, Watched because a dear friend of mine has a small part in it Not sure the world needed this odd and uneven movie psychoanalyzing Hitler  Interesting that it came out the same year as John Huston s movie about Freud  Intercuts scenes of Hitler obsessing over his niece and his late mother with actual archival footage  with an overemphasis on the former   Scenes about the Reichstag fire and Hitler invading Poland and France are dealt with in very short order with an occasional newsreel type voiceover None of the American actors playing Hitler s inner circle are convincing  except maybe the actor playing the ill fated Ernst R hm  As for Basehart himself  maybe I m too fond of the actor to see him as Hitler  Despite the mustache and all  he offers probably not the best Hitler portrayal but also probably not the worst  Not that I ever plan on watching more dramatized biopics like this one  Maybe someday I ll finally watch Downfall with another actor I love  Bruno Ganz  And not just that scene that s been memed to death ,2.0,sknolle
102155,Hitler,1962, This really is an oddball curio  with its relatively low budget forcing it to be played out completely in studio interiors  save for the odd deployment of ill matching stock footage taking care of little matters like the Nuremberg rallies  the invasion of half of Europe and the fall of Berlin  Hitler s entire mania is seen to be founded in an uncontrollable mother fixation  which frequently has him facing up to his impotence with her lookalikes embodied in both his niece  who he conveniently has bumped off  and Eva Braun  The psychosexual angle was probably quite daring for its time  but it is largely ineffective because it is all handled in such a cumbersome fashion  all sweaty side partings and anguished heads buried in hands and bosoms  There s an earnestness about it that unfortunately tends to elicit giggles on a regular basis  not least when the breezy narration sporadically remembers to kick in just to get viewers up to speed on the latest state of play in the Teutonic loon s rise and fall  A few familiar biographical landmarks are thrown in  and World War 2 is dealt with snappily in the last 30 minutes  right up to the wedding  suicide and immolation in the Berlin bunker  This is just before the narrator reminds us about what a terrible bloke he was and how his sort must never be allowed to prosper again etc  etc  While there is frequent recourse to anti Semitic ranting by the lead  the Holocaust itself is never mentioned at all  Tom Cruise haters will probably be delighted that the entire plot of  Valkyrie  is condensed into about five minutes in the latter stages ,,NeilyJ

37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, So this has been on my MUBI list probably since I signed up for the platform months and months ago  something about this little film noir sounded appealing  It really didn t disappoint  though I am a bit baffled this one has 15  on Rotten Tomatoes as while the acting can be a bit iffy and it had a rather generic plot  it still wasn t that bad There are some excellent twists and turns here and there  This movie keeps you thrilled throughout as Zachary Scott portrays a detective attempting to rescue his kidnapped son  There s something suave and charming beneath all that brooding persona that s just appealing  The settings and how Lerner incorporates the trademarks and tropes of the genre are  at times  even gripping  with the subway scene definitely being the standout The cinematography is perhaps its biggest standout in terms of its technical work  There s some excellent work done in the movie using the shadows to hide some characters and project them in a more sinister or mysterious light  While  at times can be somewhat overwhelming  the score does a great job setting the mood on each and every scene All in all  I recommend this film to anyone who is a devoted fan of film noir  Again  even though the plot and premise are a little too generic  it s still enjoyable TODAY SCHEDULEGuilty BystanderNicky s FilmThe Driller KIllerSputnik,3.5,"Rafael ""Parker!!""

37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, Shot guerilla style in New York City on a tiny budget  Guilty Bystander was quite a departure for its Hollywood rooted starts  particularly Zachary Scott and his frequent screen partner Faye Emerson  by then nearly retired  The movie is newly  beautifully restored  and ot offers a great look at the seeder sides of NYC in 1950  Though its screenplay is sometimes overwrought and or uncomfortably on the nose  Scott s performance as the alcoholic  wash up ex cop Max Thursday is impressive and moving  and the self loathing that he brings to the character  according to Eddie Mueller  Scott was himself an alcoholic  is almost uncomfortable in its intensity The movie is often quite uneven  but the scenes that Max shares with Angel  Kay Medford  a sex worker who s just as damaged as he is  rise above their familiar  conventional trappings on the strength of the work of Scott and Medford  These two jaded  exhausted people  neither sure they re willing to put in the work required to survive anymore  let down their defenses together  if only for just a minute or two  Angel  who had been a cliche just moments before  is suddenly a fully rendered human being  someone whose old identity   the tease with the magnificent body and stunning smile  who men showered with furs and jewels   clings to her like smoke  And Thursday sees it  too  He s manipulating her with his heavy handed seduction   using her  he tells himself   but there s are moments for both of them during which it s all suddenly very real  Both Max and Angel desperately crave connection   warmth  humanity   and the realization that it s right there  within reach  is so real it nearly cripples them both  And then the real world intervenes  their defenses go back up  Max recovers first  remember why he s there  what he wants from her  and Max sacrifices Angel so that he can survive  reaffirming the self loathing in which he constantly marinates ,3.0,sakana1
37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, The latest Saturday night screening on TCM s Noir Alley was for Guilty Bystander  an occasionally engaging but largely convoluted detective story from indie director Joseph Lerner  Filmed in NYC  the drama follows Max Thursday  a tremendous performance from Zachary Scott  a disgraced former cop turned house dick  wasting his days and nights rotting away in a fleabag hotel  Max s help is enlisted by his ex wife Georgia  Faye Emerson  when their young son Jeff and Georgia s brother Fred disappear  many scenes require characters to dump exposition  rambling on for so long that oftentimes I was left utterly lost as to who had done what to whom and for which reasons Again  the use of locations is excellent  Scott s work here is fantastic  oh  those haunted eyes  and he s ably supported by such wonderful character actors as Mary Boland  Sam Levene  J  Edward Bromberg  Kay Medford  Jed Prouty and Jesse White  but the ridiculous plotting  strangely relaxed tone for significant stretches  this IS a narrative about a missing child  the big twist at the end that I predicted early on  an unsurprisingly terrible performance by Faye Emerson  I ve seen several of her Warner Brothers features and have been massively underwhelmed by her every time  and my disdain for her character s actions  why does Georgia keep supplying Max with booze when she knows he s an alcoholic and he really needs to keep sober to find their kid  are unavoidable letdowns  If you love Zach Scott  though  you ll still be glad to catch this rarity  the preservation of which was made possible by Nicolas Winding Refn   another check mark for him in my book  despite not yet delving into his filmography ,3.0,theironcupcake
37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, First  guilty pleasure   Zachary Scott  Second   how did it take Hollywood until 1950 to release a film tilted   Guilty Bystander  Talk about low hanging fruit  and it s super pulpy  Guerrilla filmed on location in the tattered  skid marked briefs of NYC  Then down into the bowels of the subway for a fabulous chase on the tracks   a poor man s Third Man   in the same station as Pelham 1 2 3 would barrel through years later  Old Hollywood dam Mary Boland steals the show as Smitty  the flophouse h teli re  Smitty reminds me one of Sam Fuller s tough old broads  Tak  to Nicolas Winding Refn for the spearheading the restoration  I must say I like this more than his movies  Noir Alley July 4  2021,3.5,Channing Pomeroy
37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, So sad and desperate with the unreadable plot adding to the stuck without options feeling  Shot like each lamp on the set was one more than the producers could afford  but with a concrete sense of place  If you ever had a hard time kicking a habit  Scott s performance is hard to shake ,3.5,Filipe Furtado

37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, Lerner only made four theatrical films  all  unusually for the time  produced in New York City  Two were about fighting   his debut  The Fight Never Ends  which featured boxer Joe Louis  and is now believed lost  and his final film  the hard to find Mister Universe  which was about the shadier side of pro wrestling  Legal and financial difficulties with Mister Universe drove Lerner to abandon film for tv commercial directing  but in between his two fight films  he directed two of the more distinctive no budget noirs of the era  Guilty Bystander and C Man  Guilty Bystander figures somewhere in most essential noir lists  and it s so noir you sometimes wonder if they forgot to turn the camera on  It s surprisingly gritty  and certainly captures the spirit of noir better than most contemporaneous Hollywood films with ten times the budget  but it s let down a bit by a needlessly convoluted plot and an ending out of keeping with the tone of the rest of the pic ,3.5,Flip Trotsky
37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, There are elements of the film that I really liked  The seedy underbelly and run down hotel are atmospheric backgrounds and Mary Boland in particular are highlights  but it s unfortunate everything else isn t up to scratch  The characterisation of Max Thursday as the cynical  alcoholic ex cop makes for a potentially memorable noir hero  but Zachary Scott hams it a little too much for my liking  The plot development is uninteresting at best and nonsensical at worst  It also doesn t help that just about every other scene is accompanied by over dramatic music that messes with the building of tension and mood that good noirs can accomplish ,3.0,brintharaj
37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, Its always almost  til you get there A valid little noir that makes good use of its moody locations and technical excellence  Zachary Scott  probably more known for his villainous roles  is perfectly cast here  as his reputation just adds to the unreliability of his character  an alcoholic ex cop  The supporting cast  most notably Faye Emerson  Mary Boland and J  Edward Bromberg compliment him well and allow for a heap of interesting sequences  most of which occur during the first half  Following that  the plot gets increasingly more messy  the music vexatiously more dramatic  ultimately culminating in a solid  albeit dissatisfying finale ,3.5,seb
37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, Darker and grittier than the average 1950 crime melodrama  Joseph Lerner s Guilty Bystander is if not a lost classic something of an imperfect low budget gem  Zachary Scott gives a fairly nuanced and convincing performance in the lead as an alcoholic ex cop searching the NYC demimonde for his abducted son and it s this grimy milieu that sets the movie apart from the usual fare of the day  The rest of the cast is quite good as well  The pacing drags at times and Dimitri Tiomkin s overwrought score intrudes frequently but Guilty Bystander is a unique and engaging viewing experience for Film Noir aficionados ,3.5,Mike Johnson
37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, halfway through this I got up to get water and noticed our cat had gotten out of the house and was missing  I went digging around for him outside and I felt a little bit like this movie s detective  a couple drinks in  a little confused and distracted  and looking for my boy  this is a deceptive noir that serves up pretty nasty comments on wealth  police  and alcoholism  wrapped up in a confusing plot that only adds to the movie s boozy fugue by keeping the focus on the individual moments rather than a larger connective tissue  big ups to this thing for its shoestring budget  natural camera style and location shooting  and the complete destruction of the leading man s effortless cool that is so prevalent in a lot of noir   we found our cat btw ,3.5,Elijah Johnston
37485,Guilty Bystander,1950, Alcoholic ex cop Zachary Scott stumbles through two hellish nights in search of his son  diamonds and a murderer in this shambolic noir  which anticipates the psychologically crippled anti heroes of New Hollywood and the nocturnal nightmarish world of After Hours  without always realising what it s doing When square jawed ex wife Faye Emerson finds Scott passed out pissed  a house dick in a flop house  and tells him their son is missing  you imagine he ll have a wash and a shave and turn right into a superhero  that s how Liam Neeson was treated in the excellent A Walk Among the Tombstones  having quit the force and the drink  Instead Scott ambles into a meeting with the prime suspect  gets offered a whisky and spends the next 14 hours in the drunk tank before being arrested for murder Those scenes are great on paper  less convincing on celluloid  as it s not clear  a  who the suspect is   b  what Scott is doing   c  exactly what s happening  In a way that confusion adds to the fun  heightening the film s sense of booze addled disorientation  but it would have been more effective if it was employed intentionally  strategically  psychologically  I realise Raymond Chandler didn t know who committed one of the murders in The Big Sleep  but there s a reason why Chinatown is better than The Two Jakes  and it s not just because it was directed by that talented nonce Scott   a sort of faintly upmarket Lee van Cleef  with the same widow s peak  overbite and aquiline nose   was a Warner contract player who never quite made it  though endures in the pages of various Hollywood memoirs as the noted antagonist of the studio s  Irish Mafia   Cagney  Pat O Brien  Frank McHugh  He was debonair  high minded and rich  with an ever present gold earring  and they  weren t He never quite convinces here  And while there s something about wooden acting in B movies that can make them more compelling   enhancing the atmosphere of unreality   that isn t not true of the more complex roles  Here you catch him acting five times a minute  and while the story gives you a few fine insights into the mind of an alcoholic  neither the dialogue nor Scott s performance seem to have any idea what one is  The exception is a single fantastic  dreamlike sequence in the last act  where his flailing protagonist   shot  still hammered  clinging to some fragment of a clue   insists on rousing the flop house tenants from their beds at 4am  floating in and out of these disordered tableaux like he isn t there at all His limitations elsewhere mean that when he s opposite the drab  vacant Emerson  the film stalls  though when he has someone else to bounce off  it still works  The supporting cast here is second tier but first rate  you know these parts would be played by Peter Lorre  Joseph Calleia and Rhonda Fleming if the producers had the money  but what we get instead is just as fascinating  Everyone s favourite scene stealing communist  J  Edward Bromberg  has just two scenes  and one of those isn t especially demanding  but walks away with his final film  playing a fey  pill popping thug in a warehouse penthouse who d probably kill you if he didn t have to keep his heart rate down  His performance is so commanding  and so delightfully odd  the kind of thing that Gary Oldman believed he was doing in Leon  but obviously wasn t Sam Levene seems oddly out of sorts  wrestling with turgid exposition in his brief appearance  but there s a nice swansong for Mary Boland as Scott s gravelly protector   at least until the story undermines her credibility   and a superb bit from Kay Medford as  Angel  a nightclub hostess who doggedly eschews every genre trope in sight  being na ve  pathetic  likeable  keen  grumpy and the kind of hard boiled dame who only wants to go on holiday with you if you re a murderer  The scene in which she takes Scott back to her apartment block in search of his missing  gut shot  smuggler brother in law  there s honestly a lot of plot in this film  is also quite fantastically surprising  while totally true to its characters  It may well be the key to them In the opening scene  you wonder if this is going to be one of those outdoor noirs  like Night and the City or The Long Memory  It isn t  not really  the bulk of it is shot in cheap interiors  most notably a crime scene that for some reason Scott and Emerson are just allowed to search  hang out in  have a nap in  But despite perfunctory dialogue and direction  the lighting is pretty nice  and there s one neat if overlong fight sequence at a train station that underline our hero s essential uselessness   an agreeably subversive trick that would find popularity in post Watergate cinema He gets a shot at redemption eventually  and gets a tacked on ending which we ll generously interpret as something akin to Taxi Driver s letter of thanks   the delirious imaginings of a man who has just killed   because the alternative is that this myopically rose tinted coda is supposed to be taken at face value  and we re not having that The film is most interesting  though  for how it injects alcohol into the noir  not as an adjunct to a personality or to underscore the dynamic between adversaries  but virtually marinading the genre in the stuff  If Scott and the script were better  this might have brushed with greatness  as there s something fascinating here   a patsy whose femme fatale is liquor  encountering a gallery of grotesques on his crawl through the city  It doesn t quite make it  even while shimmering grottily in this new restoration  and the plot is impossible to follow  but it can be fabulously offbeat  and at one point Scott is given directions by Dwayne Doberman Guilty Bystander can be streamed free  in its new restoration  on Nicolas Winding Refn s website  www bynwr com ,3.5,Rick Burin

104244,The Possessed,1965, On one level  The Possessed is a haunting story about a writer  Bernard  played by American actor Peter Baldwin  who finds himself in a world shrouded by darkness and steeped in unreality  A world in which a curse is playing out upon a helpless family   or in which  perhaps  the family is murdering women  Or  maybe  nothing out of the ordinary is happening at all  and it s just Bernard s high fever that s giving the world its surreality On another level  it s still all of those things  but it s also hilarious  Because  on that level  Bernard is a pitiful  arrogant figure  a man who buys into his own legacy  at least to the degree that he believes himself important  his voice overs are infused by a tremendously amusing sense that his every feeling must be recorded and examined  both in the world and to those he s decided are important to him  In fact  his entire  off season trip to the lovely but outdated lakeside hotel at which the film takes place  occurs because he s decided he must see Tilde  Virna Lisi  one of the hotel s employees  again  after meeting her  or maybe just seeing her  the previous year It hardly needs to be said that Bernard knows nothing about this woman   no doubt he s just one of the many men who panted after her during her time working at the hotel   but he s terribly disturbed when she doesn t immediately appear to him upon his arrival and  when he s told she s committed suicide  he s utterly shattered  and is determined to find out what really happened to her  and why people won t talk to him about her death It gradually becomes apparent that even Bernard s one memory of physical intimacy with Tilde  a kiss which we essentially see from her perspective  watching him  is likely the product of his imagination  as are many of the conversations he has over the course of his attempt to discover the real cause of her death  The only thing that likely really did happen between Tilde and Bernard is that he followed her once  and watched her having sex with a man whose face he never saw   And  to Bernard  this is apparently entirely normal behavior  because he triumphantly cites his stalking and what he saw as evidence that Tilde was not  in fact  a virgin  despite it being a finding of the autopsy It all becomes increasingly absurd   and ever funnier   as Bernard dreams up more complex conspiracies  even as he finds out essentially nothing  and makes no positive difference in anyone else s life  In fact  the one time someone tries to reach out to him for him   if the interaction is real at all   he can t find the note she s tosses to him  As Bernard continues to be tortured over the fact that he wasn t at the center of Tilde s life  and had nothing to do with her death  he finally admits to himself that she was  in fact  different from the person he assumed she had been  Immediately  then  in his imagination  she turns into a wicked slut  someone so wanton in his sordid imagination that she cackles with delight at her blackmail of her father son lovers  While it s almost impossible to take Bernard and his sad boi drama seriously  it is intriguing to view the film as a the creation of his next book which  at the start of the film  he indicated would be based on some of his memories of the lake  Even in that context   or perhaps particularly in it    Bernard s impotence remains very funny  because even when he s the one determining the narrative course of events  he leave himself on the outside  pining pitifully and figuring things out only after it s too late to make any difference Italsploitation   watchlist,3.5,sakana1

104244,The Possessed,1965, 1st Franco Rossellini  2nd Luigi Bazzoni  after The Fifth Cord One of the things I m beginning to appreciate about Bazzoni is how his films feel like you ve stepped onto the moon  Sure  this and The Fifth Cord are crime films at their core  but some subtle element is added to them that renders their worlds strange  almost alien  Perhaps it s the way he frames landscapes  especially buildings  There s a deliberate choice to obfuscate wide shots  anything that would attach us to a clear time or place  We are left with scattered details  a table  a gravestone  a courtyard  to piece together a map of the world  something that may anchor us to the narrative at hand  But in The Possessed  shot in crisp black and white  that never happens  so trapped are we in the labyrinthine world of the hotel where the film largely takes place  When people speak of the alienation found in Antonioni s works  they usually speak of the industrial and modernist environments of Red Desert or Il Notte  Yet the hotel by the lake is nothing of the sort  Instead  it stands  like The Shining  as a sepulchral museum filled with the antique remnants of decades gone by  Rarely do we see out of windows  time slips away  When Cortese asks our hero if he wants lunch  it s a startling reminder of how time in this film is not so much plastic as nebulous  And it makes the film so much more disturbing  strangely  to have these apparently homey spaces turned into alien realms of paranoia  Arrow advertised this as a proto Giallo  but in reality it s more like an Italian noir  complete with our protagonist conveying his story through a voice over delivered in a curious hybrid of the past and present tense  The images are rich in shadowplay  great swathes of darkness across faces and buildings to signify the moral bleakness at the centre of the film  but also through a fascinating use of intense backlighting that wipes out many of the facial features of the actors  It s a rarely seen technique  but one that adds to the deep strangeness of the events at hand  The score cleaves far more towards the heavy orchestral majesty of a noir than the jazz and funk inspired works that come from later genre films  said score is absolutely magnificent  powerful and stirring with a superb main theme  If you have access to Arrow Video products in any way  either online or through physical copies  I highly recommend picking up a copy of this  the 2K scan is exceptional  A gorgeous  haunting  moving film Bazzoni in Order 1  The Possessed2  The Fifth Cord,4.5,Dr. Ethan Lyon
104244,The Possessed,1965, The Years of Lead It s no use  Bernard tells whoever s on the other end of the telephone   What good would that do  He doesn t want to go back  What would that say about him  to return like that  to walk backward into the past  But he does it anyway  because he has to try  he must  even though he knows it s no use  even though he knows it won t do any good  He returns to the old hotel  He returns to her  But she s not there  she s lost to the sands of time  nothing left of her but her coat  a few photographs  and his fragmentary memories   and does he even really have those  Was she really how he remembers her  even before she evaporated into the lonely mists of history  Is there any use even remembering her  Will it do any good  But he has to try  because there s something suspicious about her disappearance  something that speaks to the reason everything went so unspeakably wrong  something that begins to outline the unseen forces and their clandestine  night shrouded assemblies where they decide the fate of the world  Because what else is there to do  What point is there in doing anything anymore  But he has to try  he must  even though he knows it s no use  even though he knows it won t do any good The Possessed puts the English language influences of the giallo on full display  blending the visually dark stylistic sensibilities of back alley budget noir with the psychologically dark obsessional voyeurism of Hitchcock s masterpieces Vertigo and Psycho  so it feels almost shameful to artlessly deconstruct it as I m about to do  because The Possessed is nothing if not artful  it is a richly emotional portrait of depressive  hopeless  sad sack Vibe Cinema miserablism  but this is the game  this is what I do  this is what you signed up for  I m going to do it anyway  even though I know it s no use  even though I know it ll do no good  There are two primary thematic elements here rotating around the axis of the giallo s core anxiety of the futility and impotence of perception  There s Bernard and the perverse misrecognition of his pathological obsession  and there s the hotel itself and its social political microcosm of the Italian old guard  and these two elements come together from opposite angles to demonstrate the two different vectors of perception s failure  the personal and the societal reasons why it s pointless to look  why it s pointless to try and figure out the world around us  why it s no use  why it ll do no good unfortunately that s as far as we can go without dipping our toes into the cold water of Spoiler Territory  so turn back now ye faint of heart When Bernard is first brought back to the hotel  its proprietor Mr  Enrico introduces it as behind the times  as desperately in need of renovations  as a piece of history stuck in the past with nothing but a simple fresh coat of paint to distinguish it from the last time Bernard visited  Bernard likes the hotel this way  he says  but as Mr  Enrico explains   The rest want modern things  everything plastic  televisions  Society moves on while the hotel resists the onset of modernity  But the most curious detail about the hotel is the rumors about what lies at the bottom of the nearby lake  Its murky waters hide the ruin of an old town  according to local legend  as if it was pushed down into the depths by the persistent march of progress  The hotel is the final remnant of a long lost time  a grave marker of a sunken past  an undead vestige of a forgotten history  At the beginning of our story  Bernard saw this past with a nostalgia tinted perspective  he say it as fond memories of a better time  but the deeper he digs the more we begin to see that he was retroactively projecting his own personal fantasy onto the world  When Bernard learns that his paramour committed suicide in suspicious circumstances   the autopsy found poison on her mouth and in her stomach  which was strange because her throat was cut   he becomes determined to find out what really happened  He becomes obsessed  and like nostalgia  obsession colors the vision  it obscures what most wants to be seen precisely because and to the degree that it wants to be seen  Bernard sees a coat and assumes he knows who s in it  assumes he knows whom it belongs to  assumes he knows anything about this woman because he has a few photographs of her Like nostalgia  obsession is a fantasy projected onto the world to hide its reality  and the socio political microcosm of the sea sunken Italian old guard that the hotel and its underwater town represent is only too happy to take that fantasy projection from Bernard and offer it right back to him  to feed into it  to say yes  that s exactly how it was back then  because if Bernard is blinded by his own fantasy then he can t see the evidence of their corruption  he can t bear witness to the obscene violence that underwrites this metonymic social structure  Because as a representative of the postwar fascism of the previous generation  Mr  Enrico desperately does not want Bernard to know what he s done So the powers that be hijack fantasy  not by altering it but precisely by not altering it  by returning it in its original state  because they already know that any attempt at genuine perception is doomed to failure  they already know that resistance is futile  that it s no use  that it ll do no good 1960s   Giallo   Neo Noir   Italyi know it s uncool to do this  but i work as a nostalgic obsessive lured back into the past by the promise of a relationship that never was  if you d

104244,The Possessed,1965, It s my month for coming across movies with misleading titles  There are no possessed people in this  no supernatural doings  It s a stylish but underdeveloped thriller about the mysterious behaviour of folks in a small lakeside town in Italy  This is as recorded by a writer returning to stay in a hotel because of his obsession with a lovely maid he d previously seen there  the ravishing Virna Lisi The setting of a resort during off  OFF season is a promising one for sure   anyone who s ever stayed in a holiday spot during the dead season knows that eerie  slightly haunted vibe  And also  The Shining  This is shot in gorgeous B amp W and there s certainly no shortage of mood  Problem is that raises expectations and in the end there s just not enough of a skeleton story wise to keep this thing standing up  We re led to expect high stakes and terrible revelations but the cause of all the furtive looks  scared locals and whispered allusions to the dangers of the deep  dark lake turns out to be some fairly sordid goings on Part of the problem for me is the lack of spark coming from handsome lead Peter Baldwin  who rocks a great chin dimple and perma five o clock shadow but doesn t really convey precisely why he is a  so obsessed with getting to the bottom of things  and b  gets all feverish and ill as this goes on  That s just put out there and it s never elaborated on  and the denouement is too pedestrian  Also what kind of dummy accepts a mysterious invitation from a man who has been silently glaring at him from the 10 minute mark of the movie to meet late at night in a SLAUGHTERHOUSE Anyways the visuals are a positive  Virna Lisi is shockingly ravishing  and I never complain about Valentina Cortese s presence in a movie  But yeah  no possessions here  move along ,3.0,D Rock
104244,The Possessed,1965, I knew I couldn t stand Bernard from the opening photo booth scene and then he just kept tanking over and over and over again   In reality  I was running straight towards disaster  My man  you are a disaster  Impotent  delusional  water dripping out of a faucet dull  Like  offensively meandering  No meaningful longing based in reality or even a single legitimate memory  Except for that random time he happened to watch very pretty Tilde get it on with some dude that had stronger hands  You know  As one does You ve come back for her Yes  Just for her Tragedy  mystery  intrigue nah  Just empty obsession via a total drag outsider who never knew the woman he can t quit romanticizing and to whom he meant literally nothing  To top it all off The Possessed has some of the cringiest voiceover ever  not just  cause Bernard s The Worst  but  cause he displays zero self awareness and offers no redeeming quality It s difficult to look inside one honestly  eh OK  granted  he does look cool smoking a cig by the lake  Sadboi 101 ,2.0,Amy Hensarling
104244,The Possessed,1965, Daily Horror Hunt 20   February Horror 2020 6  A movie released by Arrow in 2019 Such a haunting film  No ghosts or anything like that  though it s certainly hinted at  just beautifully shot scenery in a small resort village alongside the hazy  gloomy specter of the lake  A village where everyone has the look of guilt and death written deep in their faces  but kept so secret  So many unanswered questions  And the soundtrack  So minimal  yet so important to the atmosphere  The wind always whispering in your ears  headphones are a must  the chop of a butcher s blade thudding like an echo  a wild animal howling in the distance  such an eerie sounding film Peter Baldwin is excellent in the title role  He just looks so incredibly tired all the time  fed up with the whole damn situation  his eyes speak a million words  He has the same stylish sharp aura and inner dialogue that so many other Film Noir leads have shown  And Film Noir is sorta the best way to define this   black  n  white  heavy shadows in a dreamlike fog  a mysterious suicide  enveloping the town  and the entire mystery slowly unfolding in dreamy fantasies   It s a crime story without the detective  just a lonely soul  lost I was hoping for a bit more of a twist for the finale  really the only thing keeping this from five stars  The film spends so much time in dreamy visions and hallucinations  but grounds back down to reality so quickly with the explanation  God I would ve loved some otherworldly curve onto this story  just something to take it to the next level  The explanation we re given is fine and totally makes sense  I was just hoping for a few more questions and a lot less answers  Still an amazing film  Unforgettable ,4.0,Matt Winfield

those  Was she really how he remembers her  even before she evaporated into the lonely mists of history  Is there any use even remembering her  Will it do any good  But he has to try  because there s something suspicious about her disappearance  something that speaks to the reason everything went so unspeakably wrong  something that begins to outline the unseen forces and their clandestine  night shrouded assemblies where they decide the fate of the world  Because what else is there to do  What point is there in doing anything anymore  But he has to try  he must  even though he knows it s no use  even though he knows it won t do any good The Possessed puts the English language influences of the giallo on full display  blending the visually dark stylistic sensibilities of back alley budget noir with the psychologically dark obsessional voyeurism of Hitchcock s masterpieces Vertigo and Psycho  so it feels almost shameful to artlessly deconstruct it as I m about to do  because The Possessed is nothing if not artful  it is a richly emotional portrait of depressive  hopeless  sad sack Vibe Cinema miserablism  but this is the game  this is what I do  this is what you signed up for  I m going to do it anyway  even though I know it s no use  even though I know it ll do no good  There are two primary thematic elements here rotating around the axis of the giallo s core anxiety of the futility and impotence of perception  There s Bernard and the perverse misrecognition of his pathological obsession  and there s the hotel itself and its social political microcosm of the Italian old guard  and these two elements come together from opposite angles to demonstrate the two different vectors of perception s failure  the personal and the societal reasons why it s pointless to look  why it s pointless to try and figure out the world around us  why it s no use  why it ll do no good unfortunately that s as far as we can go without dipping our toes into the cold water of Spoiler Territory  so turn back now ye faint of heart When Bernard is first brought back to the hotel  its proprietor Mr  Enrico introduces it as behind the times  as desperately in need of renovations  as a piece of history stuck in the past with nothing but a simple fresh coat of paint to distinguish it from the last time Bernard visited  Bernard likes the hotel this way  he says  but as Mr  Enrico explains   The rest want modern things  everything plastic  televisions  Society moves on while the hotel resists the onset of modernity  But the most curious detail about the hotel is the rumors about what lies at the bottom of the nearby lake  Its murky waters hide the ruin of an old town  according to local legend  as if it was pushed down into the depths by the persistent march of progress  The hotel is the final remnant of a long lost time  a grave marker of a sunken past  an undead vestige of a forgotten history  At the beginning of our story  Bernard saw this past with a nostalgia tinted perspective  he say it as fond memories of a better time  but the deeper he digs the more we begin to see that he was retroactively projecting his own personal fantasy onto the world  When Bernard learns that his paramour committed suicide in suspicious circumstances   the autopsy found poison on her mouth and in her stomach  which was strange because her throat was cut   he becomes determined to find out what really happened  He becomes obsessed  and like nostalgia  obsession colors the vision  it obscures what most wants to be seen precisely because and to the degree that it wants to be seen  Bernard sees a coat and assumes he knows who s in it  assumes he knows whom it belongs to  assumes he knows anything about this woman because he has a few photographs of her Like nostalgia  obsession is a fantasy projected onto the world to hide its reality  and the socio political microcosm of the sea sunken Italian old guard that the hotel and its underwater town represent is only too happy to take that fantasy projection from Bernard and offer it right back to him  to feed into it  to say yes  that s exactly how it was back then  because if Bernard is blinded by his own fantasy then he can t see the evidence of their corruption  he can t bear witness to the obscene violence that underwrites this metonymic social structure  Because as a representative of the postwar fascism of the previous generation  Mr  Enrico desperately does not want Bernard to know what he s done So the powers that be hijack fantasy  not by altering it but precisely by not altering it  by returning it in its original state  because they already know that any attempt at genuine perception is doomed to failure  they already know that resistance is futile  that it s no use  that it ll do no good 1960s   Giallo   Neo Noir   Italyi know it s uncool to do this  but i work as a nostalgic obsessive lured back into the past by the promise of a relationship that never was  if you d

104244,The Possessed,1965, It s my month for coming across movies with misleading titles  There are no possessed people in this  no supernatural doings  It s a stylish but underdeveloped thriller about the mysterious behaviour of folks in a small lakeside town in Italy  This is as recorded by a writer returning to stay in a hotel because of his obsession with a lovely maid he d previously seen there  the ravishing Virna Lisi The setting of a resort during off  OFF season is a promising one for sure   anyone who s ever stayed in a holiday spot during the dead season knows that eerie  slightly haunted vibe  And also  The Shining  This is shot in gorgeous B amp W and there s certainly no shortage of mood  Problem is that raises expectations and in the end there s just not enough of a skeleton story wise to keep this thing standing up  We re led to expect high stakes and terrible revelations but the cause of all the furtive looks  scared locals and whispered allusions to the dangers of the deep  dark lake turns out to be some fairly sordid goings on Part of the problem for me is the lack of spark coming from handsome lead Peter Baldwin  who rocks a great chin dimple and perma five o clock shadow but doesn t really convey precisely why he is a  so obsessed with getting to the bottom of things  and b  gets all feverish and ill as this goes on  That s just put out there and it s never elaborated on  and the denouement is too pedestrian  Also what kind of dummy accepts a mysterious invitation from a man who has been silently glaring at him from the 10 minute mark of the movie to meet late at night in a SLAUGHTERHOUSE Anyways the visuals are a positive  Virna Lisi is shockingly ravishing  and I never complain about Valentina Cortese s presence in a movie  But yeah  no possessions here  move along ,3.0,D Rock
104244,The Possessed,1965, I knew I couldn t stand Bernard from the opening photo booth scene and then he just kept tanking over and over and over again   In reality  I was running straight towards disaster  My man  you are a disaster  Impotent  delusional  water dripping out of a faucet dull  Like  offensively meandering  No meaningful longing based in reality or even a single legitimate memory  Except for that random time he happened to watch very pretty Tilde get it on with some dude that had stronger hands  You know  As one does You ve come back for her Yes  Just for her Tragedy  mystery  intrigue nah  Just empty obsession via a total drag outsider who never knew the woman he can t quit romanticizing and to whom he meant literally nothing  To top it all off The Possessed has some of the cringiest voiceover ever  not just  cause Bernard s The Worst  but  cause he displays zero self awareness and offers no redeeming quality It s difficult to look inside one honestly  eh OK  granted  he does look cool smoking a cig by the lake  Sadboi 101 ,2.0,Amy Hensarling
104244,The Possessed,1965, Daily Horror Hunt 20   February Horror 2020 6  A movie released by Arrow in 2019 Such a haunting film  No ghosts or anything like that  though it s certainly hinted at  just beautifully shot scenery in a small resort village alongside the hazy  gloomy specter of the lake  A village where everyone has the look of guilt and death written deep in their faces  but kept so secret  So many unanswered questions  And the soundtrack  So minimal  yet so important to the atmosphere  The wind always whispering in your ears  headphones are a must  the chop of a butcher s blade thudding like an echo  a wild animal howling in the distance  such an eerie sounding film Peter Baldwin is excellent in the title role  He just looks so incredibly tired all the time  fed up with the whole damn situation  his eyes speak a million words  He has the same stylish sharp aura and inner dialogue that so many other Film Noir leads have shown  And Film Noir is sorta the best way to define this   black  n  white  heavy shadows in a dreamlike fog  a mysterious suicide  enveloping the town  and the entire mystery slowly unfolding in dreamy fantasies   It s a crime story without the detective  just a lonely soul  lost I was hoping for a bit more of a twist for the finale  really the only thing keeping this from five stars  The film spends so much time in dreamy visions and hallucinations  but grounds back down to reality so quickly with the explanation  God I would ve loved some otherworldly curve onto this story  just something to take it to the next level  The explanation we re given is fine and totally makes sense  I was just hoping for a few more questions and a lot less answers  Still an amazing film  Unforgettable ,4.0,Matt Winfield

96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, Oldest movie to have a woman s nipple on screen for a few seconds  At least to my knowledge  Because that s what I look for in movies  Woman nipples ,3.5,Florin Scanlon
96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, Ingmar Bergman s second directorial job  Social satire  almost cartoonish with its character and bad luck  I had a lot of fun with this one  even if a lot of it was of serious nature as well  There was just something about all the points scored both ways  and about the hopelessness and how it combined the super tragic with the amusing  I can understand the style not being everyone s fancy  but I found the approach fresh enough to really appreciate ,3.5,PUNQ
96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, A wonderful second feature from a young and evidently still optimistic Ingmar Bergman  It Rains on Our Love is a surprisingly upbeat romance with the playfulness of Max Oph ls and the unrivalled insight into human behaviour that came to define Bergman s career As with Crisis  this is little more than a melodrama that lacks clarity and depth  indulging in whimsy that might seem out of place in this director s oeuvre  but it feels much more like a Bergman film and the world these characters inhabit is distinctively one of his own creation   a semi dreamscape that hybridises realism and lyricism  the dramatic skies of rural Sweden are painterly in appearance  His recurring themes of relationships  isolation  the constraints of conservative society and the inescapability of the past are all scratched at  even at this early stage  sometimes ineffectually or sentimentally  which can be put down to his inexperience  but for a film made just after the end of WW2 it s remarkably modern and just with his debut  quite daring with its graphic content The recurring motifs of torrential rain and the haunting melody played by the music box add both visual and auditory cues that collectively reinforce the emotions displayed by his actors and clash with the more light hearted elements  creating a strange  melancholic atmosphere  It s a deceptively literate and poetic film that hints at the greatness still to come from this most perceptive of cinema giants and by the end  it had really won me over  in spite of its shakier aspects Artificial Eye Blu ray ,3.5,James
96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, A moving early film by Ingmar Bergman   his second feature   about a young couple s struggles against a society that condemns and harasses those who stray from conventional standards   Not nearly as complex as his later works  it nonetheless has touches of what s to come The two young lovers are David  Birger Malmsten  his first of many collaborations with Bergman  and Maggi  Barbro Kollberg  who meet at a railroad station  impulsively spend the night making love at a cheap hotel  Together  they set forth on the road  breaking into a rural cottage during a rainstorm that eventually becomes their home  David s a vagrant who s served time in prison and Maggi is pregnant from a prior casual encounter   They fall in love  relating to each other s misery   But their past constantly haunts them as they encounter  respectable  people who either judge  thwart or take advantage of them   The  rain  in the title refers to the hardships and moral opprobrium they endure as their resiliency is tested again and again The empathy with which Bergman portrays David and Maggi is touching   He also shows each lovers  inner torments and conflicts  hinting at a theme he will mine throughout his career   But they also laugh and are playful   There are many humorous moments as well   First  in the stuffy moral hypocrisy of the townspeople  especially the Andersson family   father  mother  daughter   who own the greenhouse where David takes a job   Also in the small band of eccentric non conformists  two itinerant peddlers and their non judgmental  non nonsense neighbor Mrs  Linden  who support David and Maggi while providing comic relief Overseeing it all is the nameless Umbrella Man  who narrates and occasionally shows up  proving to be something of a guardian angel to the two moral outcasts trying to find their way   All in all  a little gem of a film that deserves to be seen by anyone interested in the evolution of Bergman s filmmaking ,4.0,Stephen M
96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, Bergman is still making his way here  with a story that revolves around the struggle to be accepted by society if one has a stain on one s past   A man meets a woman who s missed her train  and they have a fling which leads to deeper feelings   The trouble is  he s fresh out of prison  she s pregnant from some other one night stand  and they re both broke   The fact that the man has trouble accepting the woman s pregnancy initially was an interesting touch  since he too is judged for mistakes he s made  and it s also refreshing to see the open treatment of premarital sex The couple seem to get a break from a guy who lets them stay in his cottage and sets him up with a job  but between those who can t accept that an ex con can go straight or the couple living together  in sin  and those who prey on their simplicity  they have a tough go of it   The film is a condemnation of narrow mindedness which I liked  but it gets a little heavy handed in a courtroom scene towards the end  and in the film s final moments  as sweet as the gesture was   The leading couple  Barbro Kollberg and Birger Malmsten  make a good looking pair and I appreciated what the film was going for  but guard your expectations ,3.0,AntoniusBlock7
96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, Yes    It Rains on Our Love  feels dated  but it also feels surprisingly modern for 1946  This second film from Ingmar Bergman plays like a cross between Luchino Visconti  Ossessione   amp  Frank Capra  It s a Wonderful Life    a cross between down to earth social neorealism and poetic magical realism  And it actually kind of works Two lovers   drifters  who meet by chance and never seem to get a brake in their lives  are well portrayed and all the supporting characters are quite memorable  A strong  if overly simplistic  story with a firm moral center has   gasp  a hopeful  amp  happy ending A Bergman film   with a hopeful  happy ending  You heard it right  Its like   human sacrifice  dogs and cats living together  mass hysteria 7 5 out of 10,3.5,Mart Raun
96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, Curious mixture of Noir  comedy and social commentary reveals a young Ingmar Bergman  whose second film as director this is  unsettled in his cinematic choices  but it is full of glimpses of things to come  There is a meta narrator  also a character in the story  as a structural element he  and Woody Allen  would use in later films  and there is one of the first Bergmanesque characters in the guise of a wicked old landlord  buried in cats and bitterness  out to take revenge on the young couple for the family who abandoned him  The Noir atmosphere is assiduously constructed  and the film works best when the young  hard luck couple are at their most disconsolate  or when they are being manipulated by the evil landlord  It is a relief when the sun comes out  but the mood dissipates and becomes jarring with the introduction of whimsical humour and slapstick  and it finishes with a dull and lengthy courtroom sequence  where social injustices are conveniently redressed  Overall  though  it is an interesting formative work ,3.0,Silversaxophone
96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, Suka pada pemberian judulnya  Hujan turun dalam cinta kita  yang aku tahu apa makna dari judul tersebut  tapi gak perlu dijelasin  Tidak seperti film Ingmar Bergman yang kutonton sebelumnya yang berat  suram dan depressing  film ini cukup ringan dan berwarna  malah ada beberapa adegan yang cukup lucu dari para tokohnya  Suka sama tokoh ceweknya btw  Barbro Kollberg pesonanya mirip Greta Garbo tapi lebih sederhana dari segi penampilan  ini dari penglihatan saya aja sih  Sayang cuma di sini doank main di filmnya Bergman,3.5,Fer
96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, Ingmar Bergman s second film is confident  technically flawless  richly observed and   like a lot of Scandinavian cinema at the time   refreshingly frank about sexuality  showing as it does a  down on their luck  young couple with a chequered past  Birger Malmsten and Barbro Kollberg  living in a small country town and finding their love put to the test by a hostile bureaucratic world  The film may be  raw  by Bergman s later standards but there are tantalising flashes of brilliance to be found here  especially in the use of a mysterious narrator who crops up now and again to pass comment on the action and to propel the story forward  Overall  this is a deliciously whimsical tale  bleak and melancholic in tone  and peopled with a colourful gallery of eccentric supporting players  including future Bergman regular Gunnar Bj rnstrand as a nauseatingly petty government official   with an off putting resemblance to Adolf Hitler    getting short rift when he tries to serve an eviction notice  The characters are not always likeable   including the two leads   but that s not enough to make me want to rain on this film s parade because  in truth  I found it to be observant  honest and touchingly poignant  Bergman and his Swedish sm rg sbord of cinematic delights may not be everyone s cup of  te  but I m always more than happy to tuck in ,4.0,trolleyfreak
96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, Bergman s second film combines earnest Capra esque melodrama with rainstorm miserablism and the result is oddly warm  The sentiment feels out of place  especially for Bergman  but the story is surprisingly enjoyable Even if a bit too polished  the film foreshadows a big theme that will haunt Bergman s work  Young people oppressed by authoritative figures who escape to semi fairytale worlds to cope  rebuild  and eventually return to responsibility Doesn t quite embrace the tortured energy of its characters  who have to suffer with a lot  but it s nevertheless well told  well paced  and holds a unique place in the director s otherwise gloomy canon Bergman Ranked,2.5,BrandonHabes
96067,It Rains on Our Love,1946, My first Bergman and only his second directorial effort  I ve got a blu ray set  of early and seemingly to a certain degree lesser Bergman films and actually this seems quite a good place to start  his reputation is so large and intimidating  that to plunge straight in with one of his more difficult bona fide masterworks before acquainting myself more thoroughly with his growing style would probably be too much   I went into this expecting a very lesser apprentice piece by a director who I wasn t sure would appeal to me all that much anyway and I was pleasantly surprised to be  to some extent at least proved wrong  although no masterpiece it is an engaging drama  certainly with more humour than I was expecting  well made with some interesting touches and even at this early stage in his career  with a look and feel that even I can identify as uniquely Bergman s The story concerns two young people who meet and almost instantly fall in love  their attempts to set up home are not helped by the fact he has just been released from gaol and she was already pregnant before they met    Things are made more interesting by the inclusion of a mysterious old man  a very Bergman esque character who acts as narrator  conscience  guardian angel and defence council   There is some overacting and some stereotyping  but the film comes down squarely on the side of love and isn t bigoted about the couples past or marital state   Having at least enjoyed this one I am now looking forward more to Bergman s other films and eventually tackling all those intellectual  snobbish masterpieces  that a few years ago I would have run a mile from ,3.5,Jumpingfrog

9051,10,1979, Blake Edwards  sex comedy from 1979 was an eye opener for this ten year old when a smoking hot Bo Derek shed her clothes to reveal that body which resulted in possibly my first ever boner  Everyone has that moment when a film opens up a whole new world to a pubescent schoolboy  and alongside Jenny Agutter in An American Werewolf in London  Bo Derek in 10 remain the women that helped turn me into a man  So she was an awful actress  so what  she made us remember sex to Bolero  Eighties style cornrows on a blonde chick  and made the most of what she had to shape a career  As a comedy goes  this has dated badly  Derek s body however remains resplendent on film nearly forty years after its release  and although our Dud shuffled off this mortal coil back in 2002  with the exception of Arthur he never starred in anything as entertaining as 10  Blatantly sexist  the humour comes dotted among plenty of naked skin amid the trials of Dudley Moore s midlife crisis  Julie Andrews plays Moore s long suffering girlfriend  and Dee Wallace provide Moore s George with added temptation as he attempts to recapture his mojo  Brian Dennehy also pops up in an early role as a bartender  but despite Dudley Moore s loveable persona this film will be remembered for Bo Derek and that body of hers which brought back memories of early VHS tapes played to death during her sex scenes  Good times  that also mark me as a young pervert ah the days before the internet were a challenge for a teenager ,3.5,Andy Summers ü§†

9051,10,1979, Blake Edwards  sex comedy from 1979 was an eye opener for this ten year old when a smoking hot Bo Derek shed her clothes to reveal that body which resulted in possibly my first ever boner  Everyone has that moment when a film opens up a whole new world to a pubescent schoolboy  and alongside Jenny Agutter in An American Werewolf in London  Bo Derek in 10 remain the women that helped turn me into a man  So she was an awful actress  so what  she made us remember sex to Bolero  Eighties style cornrows on a blonde chick  and made the most of what she had to shape a career  As a comedy goes  this has dated badly  Derek s body however remains resplendent on film nearly forty years after its release  and although our Dud shuffled off this mortal coil back in 2002  with the exception of Arthur he never starred in anything as entertaining as 10  Blatantly sexist  the humour comes dotted among plenty of naked skin amid the trials of Dudley Moore s midlife crisis  Julie Andrews plays Moore s long suffering girlfriend  and Dee Wallace provide Moore s George with added temptation as he attempts to recapture his mojo  Brian Dennehy also pops up in an early role as a bartender  but despite Dudley Moore s loveable persona this film will be remembered for Bo Derek and that body of hers which brought back memories of early VHS tapes played to death during her sex scenes  Good times  that also mark me as a young pervert ah the days before the internet were a challenge for a teenager ,3.5,Andy Summers ü§†
9051,10,1979, Piss off  George I get that the grass is always greener or whatever  but man  you ve got Julie Andrews right there  Basically the over the hill Dumb and Dumber of its era  What s fascinating to me is  for as much as this film  or at least one slow mo beach scene  has become a part of the American cinematic lexicon  it s decidedly British in its humor  The first half is terrible  unfunny  Dudley Moore is one diving board pratfall away from Mr  Bean  The second half  I have to admit  won me over  Everything at the Mexican resort was sadly charming  with our Phil Spector lookalike George Webber  Moore  sinking further into his seat at the lounge bar  finally stumbling into a situation to meet his dream girl  and it turns out she s not the virginal male fantasy he expected  Bo Derek  fresh from getting her leg chomped off in Orca  is great in her limited scenes  She s so built up in Webber s twisted mid life mind into a virtuous but vapid  broad  that when he s finally in bed with her  and she acts so flippant toward love and sex  it implodes his entire worldview  Excuse me while I add Ravel s Bol ro to a certain  ahem  playlist of mine  Dirty Business   Journey To  The Erotic 80s,3.0,Gentry
9051,10,1979, Solemn and aching with experience  tenderness solemn  because it is so damn funny  We could spend whole evenings discussing the endless contours of the Dee Wallace character  I could spend the night on that Altmanesque zoom into her face in the mirror  after he fails to get it up  when she thinks  It s me again  Edwards  gift is to make you laugh and wince at the same time  the darkness of a theater is needed to work through these private misgivings in peace  and the largeness of a wide screen is needed to fully get its gag littered profundity  as I didn t the first time I saw this on a Blu Ray ,5.0,Carlos Valladares
9051,10,1979, I like Blake Edwards sense of humor  maybe more towards the broader PINK PANTHER material  where this seems to want to blend his slapstick sensibilities thanks to Dudley Moore s Keaton esque pratfalls down mountains and on beaches with social and sexual commentary  which feels pretty dated these days Dudley Moore as a movie star fascinates me Growing up in the 80 s he was kinda everywhere thanks to ARTHUR and aesthetically its interesting he was so desirable as a leading man but the first 10 15 min his charm wins you over and kinda downhill from there That said  he s still pretty great in CRAZY PEOPLE Julie Andrews is a saint Bo Derek s hair is friggin annoying Boleo  is NOT sexy  sorry The farting old lady steals the show ,3.0,Joe Lynch

29492,Reform School Girls,1986, Happy Women In Prison History Month Supposedly Tom DeSimone  having already forayed into the genre twice before  decided to up the camp factor with Reform School Girls and turn the whole thing into more of a spoof  Which might explain why the girls spend more time strutting around in their sexiest lingerie than in their issued uniforms It is clear that nobody involved is taking themselves all that seriously as they check off all the usual genre tropes  But since these movies are practically pure kitsch to begin with  I can t say it played as much of a parody to me What does add a slight satirical bent to the film making the camp sensibility a bit more interesting than simple spoofery is that the facility in question is technically a school for troubled girls  but it operates strictly as a prison  We never see a classroom  And the only lessons being taught involve corporal punishment or forced manual labor The rebellious hard rock soundtrack comprised entirely of songs by female artists goes a long way toward adding excitement to the proceedings and keeping the action thematically coherent  The few scenes of protest or rebellion accompanied by the raucous tones of Wendy O  Williams provide more cathartic thrills than the rest of the movie could hope to muster Casting Williams herself as one of the eponymous school girls when she was already pushing 40 at the time was certainly an odd choice  But once you hear her anthemic hit  It s My Life  played over the end credits it becomes clear that this project needed as much of her no fucks given energy as it could possibly get ,3.0,AD917

26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, Marking the end of the first phase of the Carry On Series  Carry On Cruising is a pretty average affair  However  it isn t without it s charm  The plot is the standard Carry On fare  Carry On Cruising  more than some of the other films in the series  definitely evokes the humour of a seaside postcard  The plot is really quite fun with some great jokes and moments of slapstick  However  there are a few too many dull moments  Some scenes and jokes also go on for too long  Very few of the regulars appear in this film but the new faces who have been added to the roster for this entry are very good in their roles  The only notable regulars who appear in this film are Sid James  Kenneth Williams and Kenneth Connor who are all great in their roles  Gerald Thomas s direction for Carry On Cruising is really strong and brings everything together well  Overall  Carry On Cruising has it s moments and plenty of charm  However  it isn t the most memorable entry in the series  I feel like much doesn t stand out about this film  It is very middle of the road which results in Carry On Cruising getting lost amongst the other films in the series  Still  I do enjoy a good deal of this film  It definitely could ve been better but it is still a watchable bit of fun ,3.0,Sophie Farrell
26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, Of all the Carry On s that Charles Hawtrey did this was the one were Peter Rogers refused to accede to his demands and so he was replaced by Lance Percival It feels as though they modified the script away from Hawtrey s pervy bawdishness and made the character of the cook more generically silly Also Sid James doesn t slither and sleaze over the ladies as he does in the later entries Watched because Count Arthur Strong was trying to find his copy that he bought in a charity shop for  1 99 Dilys Laye replaced Joan Sims and despite not having the same chemistry with the cast she is fresh and energetic presence who keeps things sailing along nicely ,2.5,gibson8

26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, The sixth Carry On film and the first to be made in colour  Carry On Cruising follows the standard formula of those early  more innocent entries in the series  a ragtag bunch of misfits and hopeless cases take up duties beneath an authoritarian figure with a kindly heart  In this case  the misfits are Kenneth Williams  Kenneth Connor and Lance Percival  the new last minute additions to a ship s crew for a voyage round the Med  increasingly exasperating their captain played by Sid James Percival  who died earlier this year  appears in his one and only Carry On as the ship s cook and was himself a last minute replacement for Charles Hawtry  who had fallen out of Gerald Thomas and Peter Rogers  favour by demanding top billing and a star on his dressing room door  Likewise the wonderful Dilys Laye was called in at short notice to replace series regular Joan Sims as Liz Fraser s travelling companion when Sims fell ill  Laye and Fraser make a wonderful pair  fnar  fnar  and their breezy charm and impeccable comic timing certainly helps enliven the proceedings  but it s Esma Cannon as a dotty and diminutive old dear  or  demented pixie  as Sid James  captain refers to her at one point  who steals the film from under everyone s nose with her hilarious  eccentric turn  Indeed a lot of the fun comes more from the passengers in this film as opposed to the new recruit misfits and I wonder if that was to do with the lack of Hawtry making them less of a familiar core team or whether it was to do with the storyline itself The colour cinematography certainly lends Carry On Cruising a bright and glamourous look compared to the previous entries but its clear that s the only place where the money was spent  this particular cruise never leaving the familiar and reliable Pinewood Studios ,3.0,Mark Cunliffe üáµüá∏

26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, Marks the end of the first phase of the Carry On series  It s the last film scripted by Norman Hudis  who had scripted all the films up to this point  He left for the more lucrative American TV market  It s the first Carry On in colour  which reinforces the saucy  picture postcard origins of much of the humour  It s the first Carry On without Charles Hawtrey  who quarrelled with producer Peter Rogers over billing  Hawtrey felt his name was too low in the credits  so he was replaced by Lance Percival  a less flighty  more grounded presence  though still funny  And Joan Sims  who had built up a head of steam in the previous four films  had to be substituted at the last minute due to illness by Dilys Laye  Laye plays the main romantic interest for Kennth Connor s ship doctor  and she is partnered with a returning Liz Frazer  from Carry On Regardless  they make a very cute and sexy blonde duo  Structurally  it s similar to Carry On Constable  a bunch of new recruits turn up to cause problems for the Captain  Sid James  who wants smooth sailing in order to secure a promotion to a larger ship  Not surprisingly  the story idea is credited to Eric Barker  who played the Station captain in Constable  It s less frenetic than the previous two entries in the series  similar in tone and pacing to Carry On Teacher  This gives the actors more chance to round out their characters  Kenneth Williams  for example  is a little more subdued than his usual broad caricature as the ship s new first officer  this might be  in part  because of the extended dialogue scenes he shares with Sid James  they establish an amusing class dynamic   Sid  the no nonsense down to earth Captain against Williams  arrogant public school boy attitude  The other standout performance  beside the typically immaculate work of James  Williams and Connor  is Esma Cannon as a perky old woman travelling alone but having a whale of time  easily outpacing the youngsters ,3.0,Silversaxophone

26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, Carry On Cruising marked the end of the first phase of the Carry On series  It was the last film in the series to be written by Norman Hudis who has scripted all the films up to this point  It was also the first Carry On film to be in colour  something which reinforced the typically naughty seaside postcard aspects of the Carry On films and the type of humour that features in them  However  Carry On Cruising wasn t quite the ending to this phase in the series that I was hoping for Carry On Cruising follows a similar plot to that of Carry On Constable  Captain Wellington Crowther  captain of the cruise liner The SS Happy Wanderer  has five of his regular crew replaced at short notice before a new cruise voyage begins  These replacements include a sea sick head chef and a love sick doctor  Crowther is dismayed at being given five incompetent new crew members but he also discovers that some of the passengers are a bit strange too  These include friends Flo and Gladys who are looking for love  dotty old dear Bridget and an unnamed passenger whose always first to the bar in order to forget an unidentified woman  The script for this film is solid enough to fit in with the blueprint laid by the previous five films  Its much less frenetic than some of the earlier entries and feels similar in its tone and pacing to Carry On Teacher  However  when watching Carry On Cruising  I felt like nothing much was happening  While there are a number of standout scenes and character moments  there isn t much in this film that s really memorable  A number of the characters just felt a bit dull and not all the jokes landed  This may have something to do with the fact that many of the regulars who had appeared in the previous films don t appear in this one for a number of reasons  However  I feel like this is more likely due to the script being a bit weaker than some of the previous ones  Very few of the regulars appear in Carry On Cruising  Only Sid James  Kenneth Williams and Kenneth Connor make appearances here  All three give great performances  especially Williams who is a bit more subdued than usual  Carry On Cruising is the first Carry On film without Charles Hawtrey who had fallen out with the series  producer  Peter Rogers  over his billing in the credits of the previous films  He was replaced with Lance Percival who would make his only appearance in the series in this film  He does a very good job with the role of the head chef and gets some really good scenes  many revolving around his sea sickness  Joan Sims was due to appear in this film until illness meant she was replaced at the last minute by Dilys Laye who is paired with a returning Liz Fraser  Both a lovely in this film and make a wonderful comedic duo  especially Fraser whose comic timing continues to be brilliant  However  the real scene stealer in Carry On Cruising is Esma Cannon as Bridget  She gets so many of the best scenes in the film  with my personal favourite being the one where she gets spectacularly drunk  She s just so much fun to watch Gerald Thomas is  as per usual  in the director s chair and does a solid job  However  there doesn t seem to be as much energy in his direction and it feels like he s starting to run out of steam here  The colour by Eastman is really rather lovely and gives Carry On Cruising the feeling of a film with a bigger budget than what it probably had  It really does give it a bright and glamourous look than some of the previous films  It does seem like most of the film s budget went on the colour cinematography as some of the sets look a bit cheaper than usual  Overall  Carry On Cruising is very much a middle of the road Carry On film  There isn t much of an energy to Carry On Cruising which sadly makes it feel a bit dull at times  I do feel that this film is worth watching for the lovely colour cinematography and the performances alone  While there are a good number of funny and memorable scenes in Carry On Cruising  there are too many that are a bit dull and forgettable  A must watch for fans of the series but for casual viewers  I feel like they would get more out of the previous five films than this one  Could have been better but still watchable ,3.0,Sophie Farrell
26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, My favourite carry on film so far The carry on films have reached colour  I really enjoyed this one  I think purely because the film set itself up with a lot of interesting things it could do  Seeing these actors get up to some stupid stuff on a cruise was very fun As per normal I don t have loads to say on this one but it was very fun and I had some good laughs with it  Like all the cards on films  it didn t blow me away  But for nearly an hour and a half it gave me some entertaining moments 6 5 10,3.0,Movie Bug

26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, Marking the end of the first phase of the Carry On Series  Carry On Cruising is a pretty average affair  However  it isn t without it s charm  The plot is the standard Carry On fare  Carry On Cruising  more than some of the other films in the series  definitely evokes the humour of a seaside postcard  The plot is really quite fun with some great jokes and moments of slapstick  However  there are a few too many dull moments  Some scenes and jokes also go on for too long  Very few of the regulars appear in this film but the new faces who have been added to the roster for this entry are very good in their roles  The only notable regulars who appear in this film are Sid James  Kenneth Williams and Kenneth Connor who are all great in their roles  Gerald Thomas s direction for Carry On Cruising is really strong and brings everything together well  Overall  Carry On Cruising has it s moments and plenty of charm  However  it isn t the most memorable entry in the series  I feel like much doesn t stand out about this film  It is very middle of the road which results in Carry On Cruising getting lost amongst the other films in the series  Still  I do enjoy a good deal of this film  It definitely could ve been better but it is still a watchable bit of fun ,3.0,Sophie Farrell
26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, Of all the Carry On s that Charles Hawtrey did this was the one were Peter Rogers refused to accede to his demands and so he was replaced by Lance Percival It feels as though they modified the script away from Hawtrey s pervy bawdishness and made the character of the cook more generically silly Also Sid James doesn t slither and sleaze over the ladies as he does in the later entries Watched because Count Arthur Strong was trying to find his copy that he bought in a charity shop for  1 99 Dilys Laye replaced Joan Sims and despite not having the same chemistry with the cast she is fresh and energetic presence who keeps things sailing along nicely ,2.5,gibson8
26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, Shut your porthole The Carry On gang go out to sea in one of their earlier efforts  the first one ever in color  Having spent eight years of my own life working on cruise ships  I was anxious to see this entry Sid James plays the captain of a cruise ship in the Mediterranean  He doesn t get to be very funny in this one because the captain has to keep all the other oddballs in line instead  No horny old laughter from him this time  Lance Percival was a last minute replacement for Charles Hawtrey as the ship s cook  He s quite funny  a shame they never had him back again  Charles Hawtrey would have been even funnier though  I would imagine  Not as tawdry as the later entries  perfect for the afternoon TCM crowd  I suppose ,4.0,Lebowskidoo üá®üá¶ üé¨ üçø
26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, The sixth Carry On film and the first to be made in colour  Carry On Cruising follows the standard formula of those early  more innocent entries in the series  a ragtag bunch of misfits and hopeless cases take up duties beneath an authoritarian figure with a kindly heart  In this case  the misfits are Kenneth Williams  Kenneth Connor and Lance Percival  the new last minute additions to a ship s crew for a voyage round the Med  increasingly exasperating their captain played by Sid James Percival  who died earlier this year  appears in his one and only Carry On as the ship s cook and was himself a last minute replacement for Charles Hawtry  who had fallen out of Gerald Thomas and Peter Rogers  favour by demanding top billing and a star on his dressing room door  Likewise the wonderful Dilys Laye was called in at short notice to replace series regular Joan Sims as Liz Fraser s travelling companion when Sims fell ill  Laye and Fraser make a wonderful pair  fnar  fnar  and their breezy charm and impeccable comic timing certainly helps enliven the proceedings  but it s Esma Cannon as a dotty and diminutive old dear  or  demented pixie  as Sid James  captain refers to her at one point  who steals the film from under everyone s nose with her hilarious  eccentric turn  Indeed a lot of the fun comes more from the passengers in this film as opposed to the new recruit misfits and I wonder if that was to do with the lack of Hawtry making them less of a familiar core team or whether it was to do with the storyline itself The colour cinematography certainly lends Carry On Cruising a bright and glamourous look compared to the previous entries but its clear that s the only place where the money was spent  this particular cruise never leaving the familiar and reliable Pinewood Studios ,3.0,Mark Cunliffe üáµüá∏

26190,Carry On Cruising,1962, Marks the end of the first phase of the Carry On series  It s the last film scripted by Norman Hudis  who had scripted all the films up to this point  He left for the more lucrative American TV market  It s the first Carry On in colour  which reinforces the saucy  picture postcard origins of much of the humour  It s the first Carry On without Charles Hawtrey  who quarrelled with producer Peter Rogers over billing  Hawtrey felt his name was too low in the credits  so he was replaced by Lance Percival  a less flighty  more grounded presence  though still funny  And Joan Sims  who had built up a head of steam in the previous four films  had to be substituted at the last minute due to illness by Dilys Laye  Laye plays the main romantic interest for Kennth Connor s ship doctor  and she is partnered with a returning Liz Frazer  from Carry On Regardless  they make a very cute and sexy blonde duo  Structurally  it s similar to Carry On Constable  a bunch of new recruits turn up to cause problems for the Captain  Sid James  who wants smooth sailing in order to secure a promotion to a larger ship  Not surprisingly  the story idea is credited to Eric Barker  who played the Station captain in Constable  It s less frenetic than the previous two entries in the series  similar in tone and pacing to Carry On Teacher  This gives the actors more chance to round out their characters  Kenneth Williams  for example  is a little more subdued than his usual broad caricature as the ship s new first officer  this might be  in part  because of the extended dialogue scenes he shares with Sid James  they establish an amusing class dynamic   Sid  the no nonsense down to earth Captain against Williams  arrogant public school boy attitude  The other standout performance  beside the typically immaculate work of James  Williams and Connor  is Esma Cannon as a perky old woman travelling alone but having a whale of time  easily outpacing the youngsters ,3.0,Silversaxophone

24236,"Now You See Him, Now You Don't",1972, I m a sucker for the Kurt Russell Disney movies   Such amiable films with Joe Flynn frequently stealing the show as Dean Higgins and Cesar Romero making for an awesome villain   The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes was always my favorite  but in re watching them many many times with the kids  I have to say this one is the best of the trilogy   Filled with likable characters  pretty impressive special effects for the time  and a knowingly absurd plot  It may be bad writing  but I prefer to think that they were laughing when they once again use electricity as a deus ex machina and disregard events in the last film by just having AJ Arno and his chauffeur presumably bribe their way out of jail ,4.0,Spencer Anderson

24971,Eagles Over London,1969, My 10th Castellari   Another nice  almost great  one by him The Dunkirk scenes were certainly a source of inspiration for Christopher Nolan  One or two scenes seemed to me to have been copied directly from Nolan In general  Castellari experimented a lot with blocking  split screen and so on  which makes the film more interesting Maybe not a masterpiece but good Enzo G  Castellari,3.5,TheThirdPill
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Enzo G  Castellari did this violent WWII in between his Eurowestern and crime periods  It is not quite as good as his later Inglorious Bastards  but it has lots of exciting stuff in it  The budget seems high and he makes good on expansive action and his talent for staging mayhem is in fine form  There s a lot of action in this and as long as it centers more on it than its spy plot  Eagles Over London is among the better among the glut of post Dirty Dozen WWII films ,3.0,Filipe Furtado
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Some impressive production values  compared to the usual  help this  macaroni combat  WWII effort stand out  even though the aerial battle scenes are stage bound and pitifully unconvincing  I prefer men on a mission storylines to this kind of grand attempt at storytelling  but this may just be Enzo G  Castellari s most overall well crafted film ,3.5,Paul Corupe
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Enzo G  Castellari s OTHER war epic  Eagles Over London  is filled with dogfights  sex scenes during bombing raids  an epic opening tank ambush  bridge explosions  and Castellari s signature  a comic fistfight And the sinister looking Teresa Gimpera finally gets to play a bad girl  It s all fun stuff ,4.0,GoldMod
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Enzo G  Castellari s fact based war drama in which a German undercover unit attempts to disrupt RAF operations during the Battle of Britain  Starring Frederick Stafford  Van Johnson and Francisco Rabal The story concerns the British High Command which finds itself in the thick of a massive dilemma when it is comprehends that they have long been gained access by scouts from a German intelligence gang throughout during the opening stages of the Battle of Britain Frederick Stafford as Captain Paul Stevens  Van Johnson as Air Marshal George Taylor and Francisco Rabaul as Martin Donovan all give okay performances in their respect parts who  at times  don t know what to do with themselves  which makes it frustrating Elsewhere  Evelyn Stewart as Meg  Luigi Pistilli as Major Krueger  Renzo Palmer as Sergeant Donald Mulligan and Luis D vila as Jacques don t offer much in their respective roles and it is not the only problems the movie has The direction from Castellari is okay but it should have been better  such as showing more facial expressions to a stronger effect  while also having more of a tense atmosphere happening as well   this doesn t occur much The script is written to an okay standard by Tom Reed as it is weak in places and there are scenes that did not need to be in the final edit  so the duration didn t need to be as long as it was and the pace is slow However  it is not all bad  because the action sequences that do occur get some edge of the seat status Overall  its action scenes are decent  but it is not enough to make Eagles over London a recommendation  due to the okay performances  direction  weak script  slow pace and lack of tension and character determination ,2.0,Luke Thorne
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, ENZO s WW2 epic A fun time if you dig this kind of thing Enzo delivers plenty of pulpy action and intrigue  Fistfights  Tanks  Gunfights  Explosions  Ach  nein  Englischer schweinehund   bang bang bang  All that good stuff  There are also air combat scenes that   uh  don t get the job done  sadly  This is probably the biggest budget movie he ever made  but his resources didn t stretch far enough  The aircraft models are adorable  though Enzo s visuals are at times inspired   he throws in loads of dynamic compositions and a startling 360 degree spinning shot  This was filmed before he d seen The Wild Bunch  so there s no slow mo  but he jazzes up the movie with split screen montages Not a movie for those who are sticklers for realism   it s guaranteed to give a rivet counter an aneurysm  First of all  it takes place in an alternate reality where Northern France looks just like the Mediterranean coast   Just roll with it ,3.0,BootlegBronson
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Enzo G  CASTELLARI and his first MacaroniKombatDuring the dramatic retreat from Dunkirk  a Nazi unit  including Francisco RABAL  manages to assume the identity of British soldiers and thus get to the island undetected  A National Socialist sabotage group  Luigi PISTILLI and Teresa GIMPERA  is already active in London  The British  including Frederick STAFFORD and Ida GALLI  receive information and do everything they can to prevent the acts of sabotage  The situation comes to a head when STAFFORD lets the saboteur played by RABAL live with him because he thinks he is an old friend  When the saboteurs target the Royal Air Force headquarters  a big showdown ensues The plot is neither realistic nor historically accurate  but CASTELLARI provides suspense and entertainment  Brawls  split screens and air battles  the action is well taken care of  Luigi PISTILLI is convincing as the particularly nasty commander of the Nazi unit  And the images of the air war over England are very impressive In terms of cinematic quality  the film has aged well  Well crafted ,3.5,Zedda Zogenau
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Watched this as part of Monsters of Film  I enjoyed the heck out of this epic war film with infiltration story of nazi German s travelling to Britain to help defeat them during the Blitz krieg What made the screening even more special was that halfway through  Enzo was sitting on the same row  gazing at these gritty images There is a spinning shot that should be a text book study that shook me to the core A must watch ,4.0,Daniel Staud

24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Enzo G  Castellari did this violent WWII in between his Eurowestern and crime periods  It is not quite as good as his later Inglorious Bastards  but it has lots of exciting stuff in it  The budget seems high and he makes good on expansive action and his talent for staging mayhem is in fine form  There s a lot of action in this and as long as it centers more on it than its spy plot  Eagles Over London is among the better among the glut of post Dirty Dozen WWII films ,3.0,Filipe Furtado
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Some impressive production values  compared to the usual  help this  macaroni combat  WWII effort stand out  even though the aerial battle scenes are stage bound and pitifully unconvincing  I prefer men on a mission storylines to this kind of grand attempt at storytelling  but this may just be Enzo G  Castellari s most overall well crafted film ,3.5,Paul Corupe
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Enzo G  Castellari s OTHER war epic  Eagles Over London  is filled with dogfights  sex scenes during bombing raids  an epic opening tank ambush  bridge explosions  and Castellari s signature  a comic fistfight And the sinister looking Teresa Gimpera finally gets to play a bad girl  It s all fun stuff ,4.0,GoldMod
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Enzo G  Castellari s fact based war drama in which a German undercover unit attempts to disrupt RAF operations during the Battle of Britain  Starring Frederick Stafford  Van Johnson and Francisco Rabal The story concerns the British High Command which finds itself in the thick of a massive dilemma when it is comprehends that they have long been gained access by scouts from a German intelligence gang throughout during the opening stages of the Battle of Britain Frederick Stafford as Captain Paul Stevens  Van Johnson as Air Marshal George Taylor and Francisco Rabaul as Martin Donovan all give okay performances in their respect parts who  at times  don t know what to do with themselves  which makes it frustrating Elsewhere  Evelyn Stewart as Meg  Luigi Pistilli as Major Krueger  Renzo Palmer as Sergeant Donald Mulligan and Luis D vila as Jacques don t offer much in their respective roles and it is not the only problems the movie has The direction from Castellari is okay but it should have been better  such as showing more facial expressions to a stronger effect  while also having more of a tense atmosphere happening as well   this doesn t occur much The script is written to an okay standard by Tom Reed as it is weak in places and there are scenes that did not need to be in the final edit  so the duration didn t need to be as long as it was and the pace is slow However  it is not all bad  because the action sequences that do occur get some edge of the seat status Overall  its action scenes are decent  but it is not enough to make Eagles over London a recommendation  due to the okay performances  direction  weak script  slow pace and lack of tension and character determination ,2.0,Luke Thorne
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, ENZO s WW2 epic A fun time if you dig this kind of thing Enzo delivers plenty of pulpy action and intrigue  Fistfights  Tanks  Gunfights  Explosions  Ach  nein  Englischer schweinehund   bang bang bang  All that good stuff  There are also air combat scenes that   uh  don t get the job done  sadly  This is probably the biggest budget movie he ever made  but his resources didn t stretch far enough  The aircraft models are adorable  though Enzo s visuals are at times inspired   he throws in loads of dynamic compositions and a startling 360 degree spinning shot  This was filmed before he d seen The Wild Bunch  so there s no slow mo  but he jazzes up the movie with split screen montages Not a movie for those who are sticklers for realism   it s guaranteed to give a rivet counter an aneurysm  First of all  it takes place in an alternate reality where Northern France looks just like the Mediterranean coast   Just roll with it ,3.0,BootlegBronson
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Enzo G  CASTELLARI and his first MacaroniKombatDuring the dramatic retreat from Dunkirk  a Nazi unit  including Francisco RABAL  manages to assume the identity of British soldiers and thus get to the island undetected  A National Socialist sabotage group  Luigi PISTILLI and Teresa GIMPERA  is already active in London  The British  including Frederick STAFFORD and Ida GALLI  receive information and do everything they can to prevent the acts of sabotage  The situation comes to a head when STAFFORD lets the saboteur played by RABAL live with him because he thinks he is an old friend  When the saboteurs target the Royal Air Force headquarters  a big showdown ensues The plot is neither realistic nor historically accurate  but CASTELLARI provides suspense and entertainment  Brawls  split screens and air battles  the action is well taken care of  Luigi PISTILLI is convincing as the particularly nasty commander of the Nazi unit  And the images of the air war over England are very impressive In terms of cinematic quality  the film has aged well  Well crafted ,3.5,Zedda Zogenau
24971,Eagles Over London,1969, Watched this as part of Monsters of Film  I enjoyed the heck out of this epic war film with infiltration story of nazi German s travelling to Britain to help defeat them during the Blitz krieg What made the screening even more special was that halfway through  Enzo was sitting on the same row  gazing at these gritty images There is a spinning shot that should be a text book study that shook me to the core A must watch ,4.0,Daniel Staud

39462,All Monsters Attack,1969, in its way the closest to relatively grounded and thematically ambitious since the original  the bullied kid s fantasy of traveling to Monster Island and helping Minilla fight his own tormenter Gabara is genuinely cute and  for a movie like this  spirals appropriately out of control when he gets kidnapped in real life by bank robbers  the film actually implies that the socioeconomic hardship of having two working parents is rotting away at some kids  moral fiber  contributing to both a bullying problem and the deeper issue of crime in general  it s both sweet and telling that he imagines his kaiju counterpart Minilla getting the quality time with his father that he himself craves  i d dock it more for recycling a good chunk of the monster fights from previous films if the framing device didn t integrate it so well  with simple dual kid  and adult friendly themes  also it s funny that little Ichiro imagines himself flying commercial to Monster Island ,3.0,matt lynch

39462,All Monsters Attack,1969, Godzilla and Friends Marathon  22 of 46I m going to start off by saying that I didn t hate this  despite the fact that many people consider it to be the worst film in the franchise  I didn t exactly love it either  It s still an Ishir  Honda film though and  while it feels like a bit of a lazy cash grab at times  it has its moments  Seeing this for the first time  as an adult  who generally prefers the more serious Godzilla films  it s almost a given that parts of this would be difficult to swallow  I wasn t really on board with Minilla shrinking down to the size of a human child and talking  although it can be excused since it all takes place in the fantasies of a young boy  I was even less pleased with the use of stock footage from Son of Godzilla and Ebirah  Horror of the Deep  It probably doesn t help that I just watched those  All that aside  there is still an entertaining film buried somewhere between the trippy fantasy sequences on Monster Island  I really enjoyed the stuff that was going on in the real world  and would have preferred to stick with that part of the story  even if it means removing Godzilla from the film altogether  The story follows a Japanese latchkey kid named Ichiro Miki  who s quite an imaginative young lad with a fondness for kaiju  When he isn t exploring abandoned buildings  being harassed by bullies  hanging out with his kooky toymaker neighbour or being taken hostage by bank robbers  he spends his time dreaming of hanging out on Monster Island with Godzilla s son Minilla  Did all of that stuff I listed before Ichiro s dreams sound really interesting to you  Would you rather watch that than some stock footage from previous Godzilla films  along with some new stuff that makes Son of Godzilla seem downright serious by comparison  Yeah  me too  I m rating this 3 stars as a Godzilla film but  if the kaiju parts were stripped away and this was made into a standalone film  I d probably rate it higher  I found Ichiro s real world adventures to be much more entertaining ,3.0,Tears_in_Rain

39462,All Monsters Attack,1969, in its way the closest to relatively grounded and thematically ambitious since the original  the bullied kid s fantasy of traveling to Monster Island and helping Minilla fight his own tormenter Gabara is genuinely cute and  for a movie like this  spirals appropriately out of control when he gets kidnapped in real life by bank robbers  the film actually implies that the socioeconomic hardship of having two working parents is rotting away at some kids  moral fiber  contributing to both a bullying problem and the deeper issue of crime in general  it s both sweet and telling that he imagines his kaiju counterpart Minilla getting the quality time with his father that he himself craves  i d dock it more for recycling a good chunk of the monster fights from previous films if the framing device didn t integrate it so well  with simple dual kid  and adult friendly themes  also it s funny that little Ichiro imagines himself flying commercial to Monster Island ,3.0,matt lynch

39462,All Monsters Attack,1969, Godzilla and Friends Marathon  22 of 46I m going to start off by saying that I didn t hate this  despite the fact that many people consider it to be the worst film in the franchise  I didn t exactly love it either  It s still an Ishir  Honda film though and  while it feels like a bit of a lazy cash grab at times  it has its moments  Seeing this for the first time  as an adult  who generally prefers the more serious Godzilla films  it s almost a given that parts of this would be difficult to swallow  I wasn t really on board with Minilla shrinking down to the size of a human child and talking  although it can be excused since it all takes place in the fantasies of a young boy  I was even less pleased with the use of stock footage from Son of Godzilla and Ebirah  Horror of the Deep  It probably doesn t help that I just watched those  All that aside  there is still an entertaining film buried somewhere between the trippy fantasy sequences on Monster Island  I really enjoyed the stuff that was going on in the real world  and would have preferred to stick with that part of the story  even if it means removing Godzilla from the film altogether  The story follows a Japanese latchkey kid named Ichiro Miki  who s quite an imaginative young lad with a fondness for kaiju  When he isn t exploring abandoned buildings  being harassed by bullies  hanging out with his kooky toymaker neighbour or being taken hostage by bank robbers  he spends his time dreaming of hanging out on Monster Island with Godzilla s son Minilla  Did all of that stuff I listed before Ichiro s dreams sound really interesting to you  Would you rather watch that than some stock footage from previous Godzilla films  along with some new stuff that makes Son of Godzilla seem downright serious by comparison  Yeah  me too  I m rating this 3 stars as a Godzilla film but  if the kaiju parts were stripped away and this was made into a standalone film  I d probably rate it higher  I found Ichiro s real world adventures to be much more entertaining ,3.0,Tears_in_Rain

13945,The Sword and the Sorcerer,1982, If you enjoy this review  check out my book RADIOACTIVE DREAMS  THE CINEMA OF ALBERT PYUN  I reviewed every one of Albert Pyun s films and interviewed some of his closest collaborators SWORD AND THE SORCERER is every straight teenage boy s fantasy  A rollicking sword and sorcery epic featuring a swashbuckling hero  dastardly villains  and an insane amount of naked women  It was the kind of movie that didn t really get made at the time  but it didn t stop a 28 year old Hawaiin hopeful film director named Albert Pyun and his two friends Tom Karnowski and John V  Stuckmeyer from heading up to Hollywood to pitch it  They didn t have any credits to their name  or a penny in their bank accounts  but they had a script and storyboards  and they naively assumed their enthusiasm and passion could get them the gig  It did not  Every door was slammed in their face  No one wanted the silly fantasy stuff they were peddling because producers believed the audience s wanted STAR WARS style science fiction blockbusters  It wasn t until John Boorman s EXCALIBUR  1981  became a box office bonanza that the money men changed their tune  Suddenly  every producer wanted a sword and sorcery project  CONAN  THE BARBARIAN  DEATHSTALKER  THE BEASTMASTER  All food for an audience starving for a genre that hadn t been exploited since the Italian Peplums  It was a been a long time since Steve Reeve s had played Hercules with a sword and sandals  The man who brought the SWORD AND THE SORCERER to the screen was producer Barry Chase  He had already turned down Pyun and his friends when they first came to his door  but now he jumped on a chance to procure a ready made property  They had the entire film storyboarded  Albert Pyun wanted to direct  but he was just a kid  Barry could push him around  so he went ahead and funded the film  The production commissioned an amazing painted poster by Peter Andrew Jones  The SWORD AND THE SORCERER was released  It became a shockingly big box office hit The first credit on the screen read A BARRY CHASE FILM  It did nothing for Albert s career  He wouldn t direct another film for three years  Right from the start  Pyun couldn t catch a break  From all accounts  the experience on SWORD was a miserable one  Lee Horsley was cast against his wishes and acted like a jackass on set  Pyun fought every day with the producers and crew  No one had any faith in his abilities  It was a nightmare situation that included an immensely complicated project  a novice filmmaker who hasn t learned the ropes  and a producer that has no qualms steamrolling his way to the finish line  With that in mind  It s a miracle SWORD is as fun as it is  It may say A BRANDON CHASE FILM  but this is pure Pyun  It s got his out there ideas  the careful framing  and an unfortunate 30 minute prologue that takes place over decades and tells the story of kingdoms won  lost and recaptured  It s a device common in fantasy novels but rarely done in cinema  We don t meet the adult hero of the tale until a half hour into the film  And even then  he s only one piece of the puzzle  There s also the treacherous warlord Cromell  A deliciously evil Richard Lynch  who wants to marry the princess  Kathleen Baler  to take over the kingdom  There s a prince  Sunon MacCorkindale  who wants to take back the throne  a gang of friendly mercenaries  rival clans  a prostitute with a heart of gold  and a melting sorcerer  Richard Mogg  who is resurrected  killed and revived again before the story even starts  It s undeniable that from a storytelling perspective  this is one shaky package  It plays out in fits and starts  has difficulty juggling its many characters  and unfortunately  leans into the sexist tropes of the genre  The target audience didn t care  They just wanted to finally see all the stuff they had read about in Michael Moorcock novels finally brought to screen  And oh boy  does it deliver  It s got highs as high as you can get with the genre  There are long swordfights through castles  Crawls through torch lit sewers infested with flesh eating rats  So many naked women  Gorey violence  Evil monsters  Heroic crucifixions  Lee Horsey is incredibly charming as Talon  The action is clunky but ferocious  Richard Lynch chews the scenery  The practical effects are a joy in all their wobbly glory  The smokey soft focus cinematography may be reminiscent of Boorman s EXCALIBUR  but it s got textural grit  It may be a narrative mess  but a viewer feels like there s a world that continues beyond the frame  It s the kind of picture that almost demands a map  Pyun didn t look down on the material like the producers  He genuinely loved it   SWORD isn t a gentle bore like fantasy films along the line of KRULL  Its pure unapologetic pulp executed with vigour and passion  SWORD AND SORCERER also features one of the most absurd weapons in film history  A large broadsword that has three blades that can shoot out like rockets  It s laughably impracticable and amazing to see  on screen without a hint of condescension  I can t imagine being in Albert Pyun s shoes after SWORD AND THE SORCERER was released  Finally  his dream of being a filmmaker had come true  The box office results proved the world liked what he had to offer  Yet  the film had been taken out of his hands and changed against his wishes  He had been ridiculed throughout the production  The critics thought the picture was trash   He could have given up right there  and no one would have faulted him for it  But he didn t He was a filmmaker after all ,4.0,Justin Decloux
13945,The Sword and the Sorcerer,1982, Golden Age of Fantasy  80s So  it seems that Albert Pyun may have directed one of the weirdest Conan knockoffs I ve seen so far  A film bookended by awesome scenes featuring goopy practical effects and Richard Moll as a  whatever the fuck he s supposed to be  A goopy  demonic looking sorcerer or something  Then we see our protagonist witness the death of his father  the decapitation of his mother  and receive what is  perhaps  one of the craziest and most impractical fantasy swords I ve yet to see  I mean  this thing has three blades  but two of them are somehow fired as projectiles  But then  like  how the fuck do you reload the damn thing  Do you have to go retrieve the blades and shove them back into the hilt  Do you need special gloves for that or something  Anyway  the middle of this thing is pure nonsense  Our protagonist is barely in most of the film  And  even when he is  he seems to be easily defeated  until he suddenly becomes a badass in the last 10 minutes or so   So much of the film seems be lacking in a coherent plot of any kind  and seems to follow random characters that we know very little about  But hey  there are lots of cool scenes with some old school swashbuckling action  complete with a suitably rousing score  It s a shame that Pyun seems to have blown most of his budget on the intro and the final 10 minutes or so  but those scenes almost make up for the rest  I would have liked more Richard Moll as the  whatever the fuck he s supposed to be  however ,3.0,Tears_in_Rain
13945,The Sword and the Sorcerer,1982, albert pyun gets in on the wave of medieval fantasy that was greenlit in the wake of boorman s Excalibur  Conan  The Beastmaster  etc  and does it with all the low budget charm and ambition you d expect  occasionally a bit goofy and dull but makes effective use of color and gore fx and it s clear pyun is a genuine nerd and loves this stuff which takes the adventurous tone he s going for here further than it probably would otherwise  he s also displayed in almost everything i ve seen from him thus far a very solid eye for action that is well beyond the budgets he was given and this did not disappoint  the demon magician make up in the opening finale and the triple broadsword that fires individual blades off like a crossbow are both insane lol ,3.0,Josh Lewis
13945,The Sword and the Sorcerer,1982, The Sword and the Sorcerer  is a 1982 fantasy film directed by Albert Pyun  As the genre itself is literally called  sword and sorcery fantasy  it is somewhat a charming acknowledgment that you know exactly what kind of film you are going to get from complete face value aesthetics of title and cover alone  Bring in the overall energy of Albert Pyun when it comes to his direct vision of applicated over the top and somewhat cheesy fun  and you get a fantasy film that carries with it a loose energy to just have a good time for what it s worth  It s not the most polished sword and sorcery fantasy  not really connecting the applications of character in comparison to something like  Conan the Barbarian   1982  but  The Sword and the Sorcerer  is really just about having a good time for the extent that it s on the screen Being completely honest  after completion of the film  I really didn t connect with any of the characters and forgot half of their purpose in the film  I think this factor is why many people were on the fence about the film on its release  and it didn t get the best of reviews  Since that time  it has garnered a cult following  which makes sense as this film brings forward some fun tongue and cheek energy to the genre  This think has an assortment of weird creature baddies  half naked damsels in waiting  and this crazy rocket sword that has the ability to shoot forward  being both an amazing and amazingly cheesy weapon at the same time  Overall  just a good fun film within the genre  it s not the strongest but surely one to watch to give some variety within the genre ,3.5,"Blake Bergman ""Various Spaghetti"""

13945,The Sword and the Sorcerer,1982, I ve only ever seen a handful of Albert Pyun movies  But Cyborg has always been hugely important to me  I had its video store poster up in my room in the early 90 s and Dollman and Mean Guns were flicks me and my buddies had a hell of a lot of fun with  So  he might not necessarily ever have been one of my favorite director s  but I always knew about him and was fond of the films of his I had seen I actually never knew The Sword and the Sorcerer was his debut until reading articles about Pyun s passing online  The VHS box art spoke to me on a spiritually profound level as a kid in the 80 s who was obsessed with Conan The Barbarian  My buddy Cham on here gave this a glowing review as part of his own memorial retrospective  so that and Pyun s sad  untimely death from Multiple Sclerosis and Dementia inspired me to blind buy it in iTunes And I m glad I did cause this shit rocks  It basically has everything I want in a fantasy film from this era  Sure  Lee Horsely is no Arnold  but he s charismatic enough  Richard Lynch is frankly fucking awesome as the evil king and Richard  Bull  Moll is next level brilliant as the evil Wizard  His horrific summoning in the opening sequence is essentially exactly what I watch movies for   There s a metric fuck ton of torch lit atmosphere  Some cool sets and striking locations  It s a bummer that the supernatural elements drop out during the middle stretch  but they come roaring back in a stupendous climactic set piece that shockingly makes good on the lurid promise of the poster I m really glad I l finally gave this a day in court  There s this great slow motion sequence after the hero escapes his crucifixion as he s fighting palace guards  It culminates in a stellar moment as he catches his sword mid air and leaps into the fray against a horde of enemies  It was a rousing  thrilling shot that impressed upon me what a unique  innately talented film maker Pyun truly was  This is a terrific debut feature and it s not hyperbole to say Albert Pyun will be emphatically and unironically missed Lastly  I watched two Albert Pyun movies last night to honor him and wrote the review above in my notes after finishing the first  I watched the second  which I will write up later today as I need to get going and go into the office this morning  then went to bed  It s now the morning after and last night I had the most exciting and narratively elaborate dreams I ve had in literal ages Not just the usual anxiety nightmares  but honest to god thrilling adventures  I attribute that to the effect mainlining three and a half hours of Pyun s cinematic art before slumber had on me  I wholly believe his images and worlds unlocked some dormant  imaginative corner of my mind to run wild and free while I slept  I can think of no better reason to praise and be grateful for an artist than their ability to make the world seem like a more magical place with limitless possibilities  That s why we should all be remembering and thanking Albert Pyun in the wake of his death ,4.0,Middle-Aged Genre Enthusiast
13945,The Sword and the Sorcerer,1982, All we wanted to see was evil demon guy  Richard Moll  fight Conan guy  Lee Horsley  and save the princess  Kathleen Beller  from the demon s evil subtextual snake  using his sword that is so cool it has three blades   It s right there  on the movie poster  And bless them  we do get that  what happens on the poster really does happen in the film  But to get there  they decide to create a fantasy world that requires a good twenty years of narrative back story  alliances  demon conjuring  demon injuring  nation conquering  kidnapping  hiding  growing up  and   guys  this is too complicated  No one cares  This is like that dungeon master who has to explain every part of their intricately crafted world because they went to all the trouble to make it  Can we just roll for initiative and get on with it It starts with a promise of Dark Fantasy  slimy demon Moll  conjured by a Conan style creepy witch  from a sarcophagus covered in screaming faces  Richard Lynch using him to become King  Only one King  though  the movie has a whole rack of Kings in reserve that show up later  The Dark Fantasy moves rather quickly into light humor  though  and never quite goes back until the very end It s hilarious to watch Horsley struggle with his special three bladed sword  obviously so heavy he couldn t swing it if he tried  Luckily  the extra blades shoot out from the sword  which makes it ultra epic  He s a swaggering ass who decides to help a bunch of the good kings in exchange for a one night stand with the princess  None of this love nonsense  He gets crucified for his troubles but it leads into my favorite scene in the whole film  when he gets freed and starts acrobatically flipping everyone in a huge slow motion silhouette brawl  I don t think there s a single scene in the movie that goes the way I think it will  because of the acting choices  or the bizarre script  or the way it is filmed  or the quality of the props  Even the music sometimes sounds like we re watching an old Errol Flynn swashbuckler  incongruously  And is it a law that as soon as you become a King  you must grow an Abe Lincoln beard  Also  I was never quite clear when they were talking about actual swords  but the lines made it sound like they were talking about their penises  and when they were actually talking about their penises and using sword metaphors  Trust me on this when I say the confusion is real ,4.5,threepenny

13945,The Sword and the Sorcerer,1982, If you enjoy this review  check out my book RADIOACTIVE DREAMS  THE CINEMA OF ALBERT PYUN  I reviewed every one of Albert Pyun s films and interviewed some of his closest collaborators SWORD AND THE SORCERER is every straight teenage boy s fantasy  A rollicking sword and sorcery epic featuring a swashbuckling hero  dastardly villains  and an insane amount of naked women  It was the kind of movie that didn t really get made at the time  but it didn t stop a 28 year old Hawaiin hopeful film director named Albert Pyun and his two friends Tom Karnowski and John V  Stuckmeyer from heading up to Hollywood to pitch it  They didn t have any credits to their name  or a penny in their bank accounts  but they had a script and storyboards  and they naively assumed their enthusiasm and passion could get them the gig  It did not  Every door was slammed in their face  No one wanted the silly fantasy stuff they were peddling because producers believed the audience s wanted STAR WARS style science fiction blockbusters  It wasn t until John Boorman s EXCALIBUR  1981  became a box office bonanza that the money men changed their tune  Suddenly  every producer wanted a sword and sorcery project  CONAN  THE BARBARIAN  DEATHSTALKER  THE BEASTMASTER  All food for an audience starving for a genre that hadn t been exploited since the Italian Peplums  It was a been a long time since Steve Reeve s had played Hercules with a sword and sandals  The man who brought the SWORD AND THE SORCERER to the screen was producer Barry Chase  He had already turned down Pyun and his friends when they first came to his door  but now he jumped on a chance to procure a ready made property  They had the entire film storyboarded  Albert Pyun wanted to direct  but he was just a kid  Barry could push him around  so he went ahead and funded the film  The production commissioned an amazing painted poster by Peter Andrew Jones  The SWORD AND THE SORCERER was released  It became a shockingly big box office hit The first credit on the screen read A BARRY CHASE FILM  It did nothing for Albert s career  He wouldn t direct another film for three years  Right from the start  Pyun couldn t catch a break  From all accounts  the experience on SWORD was a miserable one  Lee Horsley was cast against his wishes and acted like a jackass on set  Pyun fought every day with the producers and crew  No one had any faith in his abilities  It was a nightmare situation that included an immensely complicated project  a novice filmmaker who hasn t learned the ropes  and a producer that has no qualms steamrolling his way to the finish line  With that in mind  It s a miracle SWORD is as fun as it is  It may say A BRANDON CHASE FILM  but this is pure Pyun  It s got his out there ideas  the careful framing  and an unfortunate 30 minute prologue that takes place over decades and tells the story of kingdoms won  lost and recaptured  It s a device common in fantasy novels but rarely done in cinema  We don t meet the adult hero of the tale until a half hour into the film  And even then  he s only one piece of the puzzle  There s also the treacherous warlord Cromell  A deliciously evil Richard Lynch  who wants to marry the princess  Kathleen Baler  to take over the kingdom  There s a prince  Sunon MacCorkindale  who wants to take back the throne  a gang of friendly mercenaries  rival clans  a prostitute with a heart of gold  and a melting sorcerer  Richard Mogg  who is resurrected  killed and revived again before the story even starts  It s undeniable that from a storytelling perspective  this is one shaky package  It plays out in fits and starts  has difficulty juggling its many characters  and unfortunately  leans into the sexist tropes of the genre  The target audience didn t care  They just wanted to finally see all the stuff they had read about in Michael Moorcock novels finally brought to screen  And oh boy  does it deliver  It s got highs as high as you can get with the genre  There are long swordfights through castles  Crawls through torch lit sewers infested with flesh eating rats  So many naked women  Gorey violence  Evil monsters  Heroic crucifixions  Lee Horsey is incredibly charming as Talon  The action is clunky but ferocious  Richard Lynch chews the scenery  The practical effects are a joy in all their wobbly glory  The smokey soft focus cinematography may be reminiscent of Boorman s EXCALIBUR  but it s got textural grit  It may be a narrative mess  but a viewer feels like there s a world that continues beyond the frame  It s the kind of picture that almost demands a map  Pyun didn t look down on the material like the producers  He genuinely loved it   SWORD isn t a gentle bore like fantasy films along the line of KRULL  Its pure unapologetic pulp executed with vigour and passion  SWORD AND SORCERER also features one of the most absurd weapons in film history  A large broadsword that has three blades that can shoot out like rockets  It s laughably impracticable and amazing to see  on screen without a hint of condescension  I can t imagine being in Albert Pyun s shoes after SWORD AND THE SORCERER was released  Finally  his dream of being a filmmaker had come true  The box office results proved the world liked what he had to offer  Yet  the film had been taken out of his hands and changed against his wishes  He had been ridiculed throughout the production  The critics thought the picture was trash   He could have given up right there  and no one would have faulted him for it  But he didn t He was a filmmaker after all ,4.0,Justin Decloux
13945,The Sword and the Sorcerer,1982, Golden Age of Fantasy  80s So  it seems that Albert Pyun may have directed one of the weirdest Conan knockoffs I ve seen so far  A film bookended by awesome scenes featuring goopy practical effects and Richard Moll as a  whatever the fuck he s supposed to be  A goopy  demonic looking sorcerer or something  Then we see our protagonist witness the death of his father  the decapitation of his mother  and receive what is  perhaps  one of the craziest and most impractical fantasy swords I ve yet to see  I mean  this thing has three blades  but two of them are somehow fired as projectiles  But then  like  how the fuck do you reload the damn thing  Do you have to go retrieve the blades and shove them back into the hilt  Do you need special gloves for that or something  Anyway  the middle of this thing is pure nonsense  Our protagonist is barely in most of the film  And  even when he is  he seems to be easily defeated  until he suddenly becomes a badass in the last 10 minutes or so   So much of the film seems be lacking in a coherent plot of any kind  and seems to follow random characters that we know very little about  But hey  there are lots of cool scenes with some old school swashbuckling action  complete with a suitably rousing score  It s a shame that Pyun seems to have blown most of his budget on the intro and the final 10 minutes or so  but those scenes almost make up for the rest  I would have liked more Richard Moll as the  whatever the fuck he s supposed to be  however ,3.0,Tears_in_Rain
13945,The Sword and the Sorcerer,1982, albert pyun gets in on the wave of medieval fantasy that was greenlit in the wake of boorman s Excalibur  Conan  The Beastmaster  etc  and does it with all the low budget charm and ambition you d expect  occasionally a bit goofy and dull but makes effective use of color and gore fx and it s clear pyun is a genuine nerd and loves this stuff which takes the adventurous tone he s going for here further than it probably would otherwise  he s also displayed in almost everything i ve seen from him thus far a very solid eye for action that is well beyond the budgets he was given and this did not disappoint  the demon magician make up in the opening finale and the triple broadsword that fires individual blades off like a crossbow are both insane lol ,3.0,Josh Lewis

29343,Humanoids from the Deep,1980, Yeah  this is still some crazy fun monster madness  Roger Corman and Barbara Peeters for the win  yo  Oh  and let s not forget Jimmy Murakami  This feels like a mean spirited update of a 50s monster flick  with slimy  rubber suit fishmen that have a taste for the flesh of human females  and I don t mean to eat  Yeah  loads of girls gonna be havin  some unwanted fish babies up in here  Hide your kids  Hide your wife  And this thing has some real bite for something from 1980  with a child being killed almost immediately  multiple dogs being shredded  fishmen impregnating girls  and a lot more gore than was typical for the era  How something this gnarly came out the same year as Friday the 13th  I ll never know  Anyway  legend has it that Corman wanted the fishmen to  kill all the men and rape all the women  And  while Peeters delivered on the wholesale slaughter of men  she held back a bit on the rape scenes  which led Corman to bring in Murakami to sleaze things up a bit  And  while such scenes are kept brief  they deliver the goods  Ok  so here s the part where some people are reading this and thinking   Jesus Christ  why are you giving this misogynistic garbage five stars  you fucking psycho  Well  why the fuck do so many people like watching brutally violent films where people are sliced  diced  shredded  pulped  and ground into hamburger meat  Have you ever stopped to wonder why most people are cool with that but draw the line at sexual violence  Does enjoying depictions of gory murder mean that one endorses violence in the real world  Look  here s the thing  I was a sensitive soul  once upon a time  I grew up being afraid of my own shadow and crying at the drop of a hat  I was a shy  introverted  little bookworm  But horror films caused me to develop a weird obsession with death and violence  But  like most of you  certain things remained off limits  There were lines I didn t want to cross  Depictions of rape  animals being killed  and graphic scenes of torture  Yeah  I had a soul once  in the distant past  Why am I writing this  I honestly don t know  I see a lot of people in the horror community  these days  acting like it s perfectly fine to enjoy extremely brutal depictions of violence and torture  but if you say you liked a movie with rape  as a man  you need to be locked up or something  I suppose the assumption is that you enjoy the scenes of rape because you find them titillating  and because you hate women and want to see them suffer  That you re probably a closet rapist or something  But  wouldn t that kind of thinking imply that all of the people who enjoy watching gory slasher films are closet psychopaths  who secretly get off on seeing humans maimed and mutilated  Or  is it just that some people become fascinated with taboos that shock and disturb them  choosing to lean into their horror and revulsion rather than shy away from it  That some people explore the abyss to confront their own fears and learn something about themselves  Or  maybe it s because some people become so desensitized  from prolonged exposure to such things  that most of it doesn t move the needle anymore  causing you to search for increasingly more shocking material to still feel something  My point is  that what s shocking  disgusting  or disturbing to you  might not be to other people  It doesn t mean they re monsters  it just means they ve delved further into the darkness  or have been at it longer  They re just more desensitized  Most of the things I enjoy watching now  are things that would have made me vomit twenty years ago  And  for me at least  it goes a little deeper than just desensitization resulting from prolonged exposure  You see  when my wife passed away  back in 2014  it kind of broke something inside me  At first  I actually stopped watching horror films for a year or so  I was too close to death at the time  having to talk myself out of committing suicide almost every day  And everything was too raw  I was a bundle of exposed nerves  more sensitive than ever  Easily triggered  But then I started watching horror films again and discovered something had changed in me  I mean  I was already a pretty jaded horror fan before my wife passed  but there were still some things that could push my buttons  Now  nothing  So I started watching increasingly more disturbing material  Still nothing  I couldn t find anything shocking enough to move the needle anymore But none of that means that I ve become a monster somehow  Or that I lack compassion  I still care about others and have no desire to see them suffer  I m just broken inside  I need to watch screwed up shit to feel alive  Again  I really don t know what prompted me to write all this  If you re triggered by some of the stuff I ve been reviewing lately  or the content of some of my reviews  I suppose you should just go ahead and unfollow me  If I lose some good LB friends  I ll be sorry to see you go  But I m not going to self censor and pretend to be something I m not in order to please people on here  I like watching fucked up shit and I m not ashamed of that  Watched

29343,Humanoids from the Deep,1980, Watched it after a week of mentally and physically taxing recordings and two stressful cross country flights that left me at 20  capacity  Any critical facilities I  debatably  have were down for maintenance  Judging from a lot of the reviews on here I assume most people live their entire lives like that  Was pleasant enough to just zone out and spend the first fifteen minutes of this movie gradually realizing that it wasn t Italian  Sometimes your body needs things that the doctor would never think to order ,,Branson Reese
29343,Humanoids from the Deep,1980, She ll use your ass for salmon bait  boy  And indeed  asses make for excellent salmon bait  as the mutated monster salmon spawn up into the small fishing village filled with drunks  banjo players  ventriloquists  and playboy playmates  and start killing the men and raping the women  Their giant claw like hands can rip half of a guys head off with a single swipe  and with another  seemingly the exact same motion  delicately tear the bra off of  Miss Salmon  herself  Linda Shayne  without causing a scratch  While our hero Doug McClure staggers around on the coast looking for his coat sleeves  his wife  Cindy Weintraub  has to fight off an army of the beasts  making sure her lesbian lover finishes her shower and slips out the back door  according to the behind the scenes  that was just a body double with a body nothing like Weintraub s  but I like my explanation better  Apparently producer Roger Corman brought in a second unit to shoot the copious amounts of nudity  compromising the original vision of director Barbara Peeters  which as far as I can tell entailed killing as many dogs as possible  Dogs are stacked on the beach like cordwood before the first bra gets popped and I ve never been happier for trashy exploitation to finally take over in my life  It all winds up at the  Salmon Festival  where one guy even pronounces the L   SAL mon  I ve been trying to watch all the  Alien  knock offs  but this is mostly Jaws  Piranha  and the Creature from the Black Lagoon  with a small nod to Alien at the end  Fun sf x with buckets of blood  Honestly this whole movie is fucking outrageous  from the hilariously doomed trawler at the beginning to the final blood soaked reveal at the end  Totally unhinged ,4.0,threepenny
29343,Humanoids from the Deep,1980, Just my kinda cheesy monster sleaze that s packed with low budget creature designs  loads of cheap gore and plenty of entertainment  I try to fit this one in every summer  And hey it s still pretty warm out so cha ching  A small coastal town is being ravaged by some horrible sea monsters  Their mission  to kill every man and rape every women  Dang those monsters aren t very nice  Well they would have been nicer if Corman allowed the first tamer version of this film to move ahead  Deciding it wasn t exploitive enough he brought on another director to add in more rape and violence  Which gives this movie a strange feel  On one hand it feels like a PG monster movie and the creatures look ultra cheap and from 1957  But then they start ripping off women s clothes and mauling the crap out of the men  Seems out of character for such clunky and silly looking monsters  And that s where the entertainment comes from  Throw in some goofy rednecks  small town conflict  beautiful coastal scenery and practical FX and you got yourself a bonified good time ,3.5,belial_carboni
29343,Humanoids from the Deep,1980, On May 8  1980  the Los Angeles Times published a lengthy article by Andrew Epstein about Humanoids from the Deep  and director Barbara Peeters  frustration with the changes that were made to it after her work was done  All of the following quotes are from that article    Oddly  she s extremely Huey Newton in the photo that accompanies the text The  irony of the entire production  which will confound feminist minded  critics  is that a female director was behind  one of the most woman degrading pix to come down the pike in some seasons  Variety review of Humanoids from the Deep It is important for me as a woman director to let it be known that I did not shoot the T amp A  which was added afterwards  Those sexually explicit shots I would never approve of  All the added scenes were just more horror and T amp A     Barbara PeetersI m not opposed to shooting nudity  I ve shot nudity before  but only when it was integrated into the story  I ve never shot rape or violence toward women  or things that would be mean or degrading  I ve shot a lot of B movies and I ve stayed away from rape  If I was ever to shoot it I would do it as ugly and unsensual as rape is  Barbara PeetersNow you see the monsters early on   and you see the girls getting dragged off  their clothes being torn off  and  the girls  getting raped  The  original  movie was not about those  things  taking over the world and women   that has nothing to do with the story  star Ann Turkel  who unsuccessfully filed a grievance with SAG  to have her name removed from the creditsI was told I would have to pay for new credits if I wanted my name off  Barbara PeetersWhat frightens me the most is that if this picture makes a lot of money  someone will call and ask me to do another  The whole thing just turned out to be an experience of horror  Barbara PeetersWhat s too much T amp A  How do you argue with that  You and I are men and we look at women differently  we look at sex differently  A woman director just as a different point of view toward sexuality  producer Martin Cohen  52 Films by Women  2023   2022   watchlist,2.5,sakana1

something had changed in me  I mean  I was already a pretty jaded horror fan before my wife passed  but there were still some things that could push my buttons  Now  nothing  So I started watching increasingly more disturbing material  Still nothing  I couldn t find anything shocking enough to move the needle anymore But none of that means that I ve become a monster somehow  Or that I lack compassion  I still care about others and have no desire to see them suffer  I m just broken inside  I need to watch screwed up shit to feel alive  Again  I really don t know what prompted me to write all this  If you re triggered by some of the stuff I ve been reviewing lately  or the content of some of my reviews  I suppose you should just go ahead and unfollow me  If I lose some good LB friends  I ll be sorry to see you go  But I m not going to self censor and pretend to be something I m not in order to please people on here  I like watching fucked up shit and I m not ashamed of that  Watched

29343,Humanoids from the Deep,1980, Watched it after a week of mentally and physically taxing recordings and two stressful cross country flights that left me at 20  capacity  Any critical facilities I  debatably  have were down for maintenance  Judging from a lot of the reviews on here I assume most people live their entire lives like that  Was pleasant enough to just zone out and spend the first fifteen minutes of this movie gradually realizing that it wasn t Italian  Sometimes your body needs things that the doctor would never think to order ,,Branson Reese
29343,Humanoids from the Deep,1980, She ll use your ass for salmon bait  boy  And indeed  asses make for excellent salmon bait  as the mutated monster salmon spawn up into the small fishing village filled with drunks  banjo players  ventriloquists  and playboy playmates  and start killing the men and raping the women  Their giant claw like hands can rip half of a guys head off with a single swipe  and with another  seemingly the exact same motion  delicately tear the bra off of  Miss Salmon  herself  Linda Shayne  without causing a scratch  While our hero Doug McClure staggers around on the coast looking for his coat sleeves  his wife  Cindy Weintraub  has to fight off an army of the beasts  making sure her lesbian lover finishes her shower and slips out the back door  according to the behind the scenes  that was just a body double with a body nothing like Weintraub s  but I like my explanation better  Apparently producer Roger Corman brought in a second unit to shoot the copious amounts of nudity  compromising the original vision of director Barbara Peeters  which as far as I can tell entailed killing as many dogs as possible  Dogs are stacked on the beach like cordwood before the first bra gets popped and I ve never been happier for trashy exploitation to finally take over in my life  It all winds up at the  Salmon Festival  where one guy even pronounces the L   SAL mon  I ve been trying to watch all the  Alien  knock offs  but this is mostly Jaws  Piranha  and the Creature from the Black Lagoon  with a small nod to Alien at the end  Fun sf x with buckets of blood  Honestly this whole movie is fucking outrageous  from the hilariously doomed trawler at the beginning to the final blood soaked reveal at the end  Totally unhinged ,4.0,threepenny
29343,Humanoids from the Deep,1980, Just my kinda cheesy monster sleaze that s packed with low budget creature designs  loads of cheap gore and plenty of entertainment  I try to fit this one in every summer  And hey it s still pretty warm out so cha ching  A small coastal town is being ravaged by some horrible sea monsters  Their mission  to kill every man and rape every women  Dang those monsters aren t very nice  Well they would have been nicer if Corman allowed the first tamer version of this film to move ahead  Deciding it wasn t exploitive enough he brought on another director to add in more rape and violence  Which gives this movie a strange feel  On one hand it feels like a PG monster movie and the creatures look ultra cheap and from 1957  But then they start ripping off women s clothes and mauling the crap out of the men  Seems out of character for such clunky and silly looking monsters  And that s where the entertainment comes from  Throw in some goofy rednecks  small town conflict  beautiful coastal scenery and practical FX and you got yourself a bonified good time ,3.5,belial_carboni
29343,Humanoids from the Deep,1980, On May 8  1980  the Los Angeles Times published a lengthy article by Andrew Epstein about Humanoids from the Deep  and director Barbara Peeters  frustration with the changes that were made to it after her work was done  All of the following quotes are from that article    Oddly  she s extremely Huey Newton in the photo that accompanies the text The  irony of the entire production  which will confound feminist minded  critics  is that a female director was behind  one of the most woman degrading pix to come down the pike in some seasons  Variety review of Humanoids from the Deep It is important for me as a woman director to let it be known that I did not shoot the T amp A  which was added afterwards  Those sexually explicit shots I would never approve of  All the added scenes were just more horror and T amp A     Barbara PeetersI m not opposed to shooting nudity  I ve shot nudity before  but only when it was integrated into the story  I ve never shot rape or violence toward women  or things that would be mean or degrading  I ve shot a lot of B movies and I ve stayed away from rape  If I was ever to shoot it I would do it as ugly and unsensual as rape is  Barbara PeetersNow you see the monsters early on   and you see the girls getting dragged off  their clothes being torn off  and  the girls  getting raped  The  original  movie was not about those  things  taking over the world and women   that has nothing to do with the story  star Ann Turkel  who unsuccessfully filed a grievance with SAG  to have her name removed from the creditsI was told I would have to pay for new credits if I wanted my name off  Barbara PeetersWhat frightens me the most is that if this picture makes a lot of money  someone will call and ask me to do another  The whole thing just turned out to be an experience of horror  Barbara PeetersWhat s too much T amp A  How do you argue with that  You and I are men and we look at women differently  we look at sex differently  A woman director just as a different point of view toward sexuality  producer Martin Cohen  52 Films by Women  2023   2022   watchlist,2.5,sakana1

29117,The Unsuspected,1947, As often happens in Michael Curtiz films  The Unsuspected excels far more as an exercise in style than the efficiency his reputation as studio contract director might suggest  His moving camera finds one disorientating and menacing image after another and the film finds a lot of pleasure in its background and twists  Claude Rains is very good  Brian De Palma must love this one ,3.5,Filipe Furtado

29117,The Unsuspected,1947, I have a tricky relationship with noirs  I m generally quick to label noir as a homogenous genre  and am of the opinion that if you ve seen three or four good ones then you ve essentially seen them all  it s because of this that I don t tend to watch them all that often  but it is really nice when you stumble upon a hidden gem like this one turned out to be one thing I want to note about this movie that I haven t seen anyone else talk about is the voice recording scene towards the middle  I don t want to spoil anything  but if you ve seen unfaithfully yours then you know there s an entire sequence in that film that revolves around a voice recording  and it s kind of obvious to me that preston sturges completely lifted that idea from this movie  not to mention the fact that this film executes the scene so well  and in my opinion is a much better film overall  but it is difficult to compare the two outside of this one scene  seeing as they re two completely different genres  just thought I d mention the similarity because I see so many people talking about unfaithfully yours and not enough people talking about this film ,4.0,eely üéÑ

29117,The Unsuspected,1947, I like matches  you never have to refill them  And when you re through with them you simply throw them away  Like people The great Michael Curtiz weaves a diabolical story painted in shadows  contrasts and silhouettes  The camera always an extension of his mind s eye  in choreographed precision of delicate visual poetry  There is a lot going on in this movie with more than enough characters that a lesser director would have made a complete mess of the script   Curtiz s effectiveness in keeping everything tight  especially in a story as implausible and flavorful as this  is a measure of what a talented filmmaker he was Great performances all around  including Raines  but Audrey Totter simply smokes as the femme The cat claws are sharp and at the ready Hoping this eventually sees a Blu Ray release After slaving all day over a hot typewriter  there s nothing I like better than a swan dive into a bottle of bourbon I am entitled to an explanation Alright I ll give you one in carefully selected four letter words ,4.5,hiruko

29117,The Unsuspected,1947, As often happens in Michael Curtiz films  The Unsuspected excels far more as an exercise in style than the efficiency his reputation as studio contract director might suggest  His moving camera finds one disorientating and menacing image after another and the film finds a lot of pleasure in its background and twists  Claude Rains is very good  Brian De Palma must love this one ,3.5,Filipe Furtado
29117,The Unsuspected,1947, THE UNSUSPECTED  1947  103m  b w USADirected by Michael CurtizCast  Claude Rains  Audrey Totter  Joan Caulfield  Constance Bennett  Hurd Hatfield  Ted North  Fred Clark a o A surprisingly open  yet convoluted film  There are many tropes belonging to crime puzzle  but also action scenes and a strong NOIR scent  The story is conventional in a somewhat rambunctious way I enjoyed it much  especially as it was hard to find I watched the 2010 Archive Collection R1 DVD without subtitles ,4.0,MovingPictures
29117,The Unsuspected,1947, I have a tricky relationship with noirs  I m generally quick to label noir as a homogenous genre  and am of the opinion that if you ve seen three or four good ones then you ve essentially seen them all  it s because of this that I don t tend to watch them all that often  but it is really nice when you stumble upon a hidden gem like this one turned out to be one thing I want to note about this movie that I haven t seen anyone else talk about is the voice recording scene towards the middle  I don t want to spoil anything  but if you ve seen unfaithfully yours then you know there s an entire sequence in that film that revolves around a voice recording  and it s kind of obvious to me that preston sturges completely lifted that idea from this movie  not to mention the fact that this film executes the scene so well  and in my opinion is a much better film overall  but it is difficult to compare the two outside of this one scene  seeing as they re two completely different genres  just thought I d mention the similarity because I see so many people talking about unfaithfully yours and not enough people talking about this film ,4.0,eely üéÑ
29117,The Unsuspected,1947, Joan Caulfield and Claude Rains received top billing but the best performance goes to Audrey Totter  She is so good with dialogue  especially the snappy kind  The cinematography was very good and set the mood well  The mystery wasn t too hard to figure out but that s OK  I was confused about the motivations of some of the characters  though ,3.5,Kari
29117,The Unsuspected,1947, I like matches  you never have to refill them  And when you re through with them you simply throw them away  Like people The great Michael Curtiz weaves a diabolical story painted in shadows  contrasts and silhouettes  The camera always an extension of his mind s eye  in choreographed precision of delicate visual poetry  There is a lot going on in this movie with more than enough characters that a lesser director would have made a complete mess of the script   Curtiz s effectiveness in keeping everything tight  especially in a story as implausible and flavorful as this  is a measure of what a talented filmmaker he was Great performances all around  including Raines  but Audrey Totter simply smokes as the femme The cat claws are sharp and at the ready Hoping this eventually sees a Blu Ray release After slaving all day over a hot typewriter  there s nothing I like better than a swan dive into a bottle of bourbon I am entitled to an explanation Alright I ll give you one in carefully selected four letter words ,4.5,hiruko
29117,The Unsuspected,1947, After a social evening  nothing cheers me up as much as a nice  gory murder An exercise in formalism of the highest level  masquerading as a noir imbued murder mystery  with a loose adherence to the term mystery    an opening five minutes that alone possesses more visual pizzazz than certain director s whole filmographies  Next to his beloved tracking shots  Curtiz shows an interesting fixation with reflections  particularly with the one of Claude Rains  his face reflected in numerous glass desks  windows  mirrors  etc  the same Claude Rains whose cruel suavity almost borders on textbook Hollywood villainy without ever completely falling into clich ,4.0,seb

38807,Badman's Territory,1946, The 1940s in particular were a year in which the western genre  which had its foundation in the most literal black and white sense of morality  explored situations that were slightly more ambiguous  where heroes and villains tend to be complicated because of the nature of what exactly is right  Badman s Territory is very much about how one s personal code fits into the world around them  and particularly how a social morality must be achieved to bring order in the outlaw town of Quinto  the good citizens request a lawman so as to have protection from one another  Randolph Scott plays the local sheriff who finds his way to Quinto when pursuing the gang that helped his brother recover after a shootout  When Scott comes face to face with the famed James gang  it is somewhat of a surprise that he is so cordial and thankful even if they are criminals  the charitable act from the Coyote Kid  a delightful George  Gabby  Hayes  shows they are not soulless  Badman s Territory is at its best when it indulges in the episodic  day to day life of the town and the people therein  including a horse race  a dance  and the shy courtship between Scott and a local printer  Ann Richards  however the action sequences are also well choreographed ,3.5,Eric
38807,Badman's Territory,1946, According to this film s introductory voiceover  there was once a time when the Oklahoma Panhandle was surrounded by U S  Territory but remained Indian land  and therefore it was not under the jurisdiction of U S  law  In between bank heists  outlaws of the surrounding states would hide out in this  Badman s Territory  Randolph Scott plays the sheriff of a Texas county that borders on this land  He pursues the James Gang into the lawless Panhandle town of Quinto and decides to stay a while  This is an old fashioned black and white western that often looks and sounds like an old matinee serial  Scott and sidekick Gabby Hayes are their usual charming selves  but the supporting cast fails to impress  Even legendary characters like Jesse James and the Dalton Gang are played by nondescript actors and given little to do  The story is slow moving without much action  Scott spends most of his time sparring with an indignant and uptight love interest played by Ann Richards  It s an OK watch for fans of classic westerns  but doesn t rank very high in Scott s prodigious body of work ,2.5,Karl Janssen

9255,Hot Shots! Part Deux,1993, All my life I have kept in mind that Part Deux is the awesome one of the two  Now on rewatch I conclude that the original is slightly superior  The sequel reaches higher highs and lower lows  and sadly a lot of the latter  I loved Lloyd Bridges as a kid  but now he pretty much falls flat for me  Also  the film has a tendency to highlight stuff that happens in the background which ultimately deflates the joke  Not that I am offended by the whole Iraq setting and goofy Saddam  I just don t find it all that funny Gripes aside  the film features one of my favourite jokes ever put on film  Of course  it is the  I loved you in Wall Street  bit  Now that is how you turn a cameo into pure gold  Just thinking it through makes me chuckle 1  Martin Sheen is Charlie Sheen s father  obviously 2  Their respective roles in acclaimed war movies get spoofed  Apocalypse Now and Platoon 3  yet  neither of these movies gets mentioned  nor does their kinship 4  both their roles in the wholly unrelated Wall Street are  though Did I miss a layer  It s wonderful All things considered  I d still highly recommend it to any 11 year old   well  to males at least ,2.5,Zeeneaste (Christian)

9255,Hot Shots! Part Deux,1993, Funny  Stupid  Funny  Topper Harley  Charlie Sheen  has been cloned into a super pumped Rambo for the deliciously titled sequel Hot Shots  Part Deux so he can go to Iraq to rescue the guys who got captured rescuing the guys who got captured  President Tug Benson  Lloyd Bridges  puts Topper and Ramada  Valeria Golino  in charge of the mission after a release of a memo to Commander Harbinger  You re Out  They re In  There s a second babe this time  Michelle Huddleston  Brenda Bakke  who is both CIA and a femme fatale  The  Basic Instinct  gags are dated  though  while Topper and Ramada s  Lady in the Tramp  gag is eternal  Also well played  and timed  is the  Apocalypse Now  gag  Where the sequel gets too stupid is with giving Saddam Hussein too much screentime  a concluding sword fight has one good joke but then goes to wear out its welcome  Some of the best action parody ever seen is also in this climax  until it goes on too long  The ending is near limp  but a couple of funny lines one at the expense of Rowan Atkinson saves it  Gratitude though for the final shot  as I ve never seen a helicopter fly around the sun before  I have more flattering considerations  One of Sheen s greatest line deliveries of his career   Do you know what it s like to have your heart shot out of season and tied to the top of a car  How it feels to be passed like the world s largest kidney stone  Ramada  I DON T THINK SO  As for Golino  she s a gift that keeps on giving  she s one of the greatest underused actresses in the history of comedy  Imagine if they made  Top Secret  in the  90 s with her in the lead ,3.0,chavel

73841,The Sword,1980, Said sword acting as locus for the gradual convergence of masters and legends  this meeting tragic but inevitable as a natural confluence of hierarchical status  A fellowship perhaps once lofted by honor and armament is split apart by said arms  whatever honor left on the surface belying one s silver tongue and honorifics said by such are all that is left  We watch a fox in the henhouse give pursed smiles as hens run around with their heads cut off  The sword is cursed to bring such misfortune but the source of said curse lies more in its social construction than material one  a symbol imbued with power from words even if said words hold no power  such is the power of men and their myths  Said myth is all that some men seek ,4.5,reibureibu
73841,The Sword,1980, This was my first movie by Hong Kong new wave director Patrick Tam and it certainly won t be my last The Sword is unlike any wuxia I have seen before  granted  I haven t seen that many  With its deliberate pacing  focus on characters and its expertly build dramatic tension  it feels a lot more catered to a  serious audience The movie has a very modern sensibility to it  not only in its visual story telling but also because of its partial inclusion of a synth soundtrack  It looks absolutely stunning  scenes are intricately framed  the colour palette is super lovely and the fight sequences are expertly choreographed  that editor deserves a frickin  award The story itself isn t anything special  but the way it all unfolds on screen is so classy and beautiful  that it just pulls you in Highly recommended ,4.0,Lou (rhymes with wow!)
73841,The Sword,1980, Patrick Tam s feature debut is a melancholy end of the line wuxia about a swordsman who learns that running around challenging people to duels for no reason other than pride in your own hierarchical ranking tends to have unintended consequences  namely a bunch of people get killed for no reason  Spectacular and gory fencing scenes choreographed by Ching Siu tung represent some of his best work  with the fast cut wirework leavened by Tam s keen sense of space and the stuntman skills of the lower tier stars  Like Tsui Hark s The Butterfly Murders  Tam brings a modernist sensibility to the non action scenes  with rigid right angle dialogue scenes and Tarkovskyian movements through off screen space  where characters pop up unexpectedly in the midst of long sequence shots ,4.0,Sean Gilman

73841,The Sword,1980, Said sword acting as locus for the gradual convergence of masters and legends  this meeting tragic but inevitable as a natural confluence of hierarchical status  A fellowship perhaps once lofted by honor and armament is split apart by said arms  whatever honor left on the surface belying one s silver tongue and honorifics said by such are all that is left  We watch a fox in the henhouse give pursed smiles as hens run around with their heads cut off  The sword is cursed to bring such misfortune but the source of said curse lies more in its social construction than material one  a symbol imbued with power from words even if said words hold no power  such is the power of men and their myths  Said myth is all that some men seek ,4.5,reibureibu
73841,The Sword,1980, This was my first movie by Hong Kong new wave director Patrick Tam and it certainly won t be my last The Sword is unlike any wuxia I have seen before  granted  I haven t seen that many  With its deliberate pacing  focus on characters and its expertly build dramatic tension  it feels a lot more catered to a  serious audience The movie has a very modern sensibility to it  not only in its visual story telling but also because of its partial inclusion of a synth soundtrack  It looks absolutely stunning  scenes are intricately framed  the colour palette is super lovely and the fight sequences are expertly choreographed  that editor deserves a frickin  award The story itself isn t anything special  but the way it all unfolds on screen is so classy and beautiful  that it just pulls you in Highly recommended ,4.0,Lou (rhymes with wow!)
73841,The Sword,1980, Patrick Tam s feature debut is a melancholy end of the line wuxia about a swordsman who learns that running around challenging people to duels for no reason other than pride in your own hierarchical ranking tends to have unintended consequences  namely a bunch of people get killed for no reason  Spectacular and gory fencing scenes choreographed by Ching Siu tung represent some of his best work  with the fast cut wirework leavened by Tam s keen sense of space and the stuntman skills of the lower tier stars  Like Tsui Hark s The Butterfly Murders  Tam brings a modernist sensibility to the non action scenes  with rigid right angle dialogue scenes and Tarkovskyian movements through off screen space  where characters pop up unexpectedly in the midst of long sequence shots ,4.0,Sean Gilman

158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, Starring  The Wicked  Charming  Dutch Icon Rutger HauerOnce again  we come upon a film that is difficult to categorize as a Rutger Hauer film because the actor appears for less than five minutes That being said  this was a nice film with a fairly original premise about two terminally ill men who resolve to spend the rest of their lives pondering the beauty of the sea  One day while still drunk and dressed in their PJs  they decide to embark on a road trip to the sea by stealing a car  Unfortunately  the car belongs to a crime boss  thus their trip of rediscovery will be fraught with persecution  death  thefts  and other surprises The two leads give excellent performances  especially considering the type of film it is  The picture incorporates elements  directly or indirectly  of Tarantino s work with those of the very stylish and slick European wave  popularized by filmmakers such as Luc Bresson  Tom Tykwer  and later on Edgar Wright  among others  I also enjoyed the snappy editing and dialogue  You also got the nearly mandatory voice overs  Even the score  which adds to the film s overall coolness  is pretty solid All in all  although fairly derivative and somewhat messy  if you enjoy this style of 90s heist comedy  you ll have a nice time with this one TODAY SCHEDULEKnockin  on Heaven s DoorThe Call of the Wild  Dog of the YukonBleedersI Love You Too,3.5,"Rafael ""Parker!!""

158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, It wasn t thanks to Letterboxd or IMDB or any Facebook group that I found this film  but thanks to the site Rate Your Music that looking for the actor Til Schweiger in the web searching from another different film I saw that this one has a good rating on the site and is also considered one of the 150 films made in 1997  So I was curious to know what was so special about it This film from Germany tells us about two terminally ill young guys who dedicate themselves to live their last days with intensity and madness  skipping all the rules  The story is a unique combination of drama and comedy and presents some very crazy situations that provoke laughter  Even though the innermost longings of the protagonists are revealed to be limited  At the same time  two thugs  by the way  one of them is the actor Moritz Bleibtreu  famous for appearing in the mythical cult films Run  Lola Run  and The Experiment  are asked to deliver a car with an important package inside  The sick young men decide to escape from the medical center and happen to steal the thugs  car  parked in the parking lot  In addition  in their last days  they start an accelerated criminal career giving them all the same and getting money for their last wishes What at first seems to be introduced as a typical American crime comedy ends up becoming  after a few seconds  a drama marked by the Carpe Diem philosophy  Director Thomas Jahn plays with both genres  shooting from cops respecting traffic rules in the middle of a chase to one of the main characters crying for fear of death  A film that goes from the absurd to the sentimental constantly  and keeps the viewer hooked by its plot Although it manages to make you forget for a moment the seriousness and drama of the situation  you know that in the end both the characters and the viewer will have to face it  when that moment arrives it does not disappoint and manages to move  Knockin  on Heaven s Door is a fun  funny  and entertaining film  with two protagonists who are neither the good guys nor the bad guys of the story  immersed in a personal situation that does not give rise to moral judgments about their actions  they simply have a goal and do not hesitate at any time to reach it  which will make them get into one mess after another until the end of the film that although it can be quite predictable and does not give rise to surprises  no doubt it is a very sad ending Undoubtedly this film is quite unknown  and the appearances of Schweiger in what this could be his best starring role takes on the role of Martin  the more impulsive and thuggish patient of the two  Jan Josef Liefers  on the other hand  plays Rudy  an orderly and impressionable man  and there is no doubt that the leading couple has chemistry  in good times and in bad  Their adventures  dressed in eighties clothes  take them to the countryside  five star hotels  tailor shops  brothels  etc  Well  scenarios of all kinds  which may be simple for more than one due to its lack of details but do not end up being so badly achieved  The plot is the strongest point of this work and it is also interesting to see that several of the dialogues revolve around giving allegories to the ocean  it gives the feeling that both Jahn and Schweiger  who were the screenwriters of the film  are lovers of coastal landscapes full of sea  Many phrases are also loaded with religious meaning  and Martin assures that whoever does not get to see the blue landscape ends up being ignorant in the afterlife  In the dramatic moments  there are also several rhetorical figures  In the sky  they only talk about it  about the ocean  about the sunset  about how fucking wonderful it is to see that big ball of fire melt  Overall  we are talking about a coherent script  beautiful and  at certain moments  full of comic humor In short  an exciting  energetic  funny  and cinematic narration  A film with some technical errors  which cannot be denied  but within all this it is interesting from start to finish  The message it gives us is very inspiring as it tells us that at all times we must give importance to take advantage of life and not think or worry about what might happen tomorrow but savor the moment  it is also full of hope and optimism to those who can no longer escape death because it gives them calm and peace by addressing it in the most enjoyable way possible Knockin  on Heaven s Door is a solid road movie that mixes drama and comedy with a touching ending  We are talking about a film whose shots  photography  and scenery cannot be compared to a Hollywood or big budget production  but they don t need to because it will not leave anyone indifferent ,4.0,Mario Melendez
158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, Knockin  on Heaven s Door is a fun German fugitive movie that was obviously influenced by a certain Tarantino movie  The action plays out a bit clich d at times but it is really the relationship between Til Schweiger and Jan Josef Liefers that keeps you invested  Schweiger showcases his acting capabilities and pretty much out performs everyone here  Many Belgian and Dutch actors  Rutger Hauer  star in addition to the German ones  This has a great emotional payoff ,3.5,Lou (rhymes with wow!)

158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, Knockin  on Heaven s Door  from its original title  is a German comedy drama which apparently crossed the border in general indifference and which I would never have heard of if it had not been recommended to me   Thanks a lot to  Stephan74 Apparently  the film is something of a phenomenon in Russia where its big hearted gangster theme resonated with local audiences  but it went completely unnoticed at home  The story is about very contrasting characters who end up liking and relying on each other  It s a story of friendship  told with great sincerity  and the alternation of comedy and drama gives it an original dynamic It s also a comedy  therefore  with a lot of gunfights  gangsters  and scenes that follow one another like little independent stories or sketches  based either on visual humor or on dialogue  The rhythm reminded me a lot of Tarantino s style  and particularly  True Romance   which he wrote without directing it  or  Pulp Fiction  but also that of Wright s  Hot Fuzz  and Scott s  Thelma and Louise   With its effective script  a lot of heart and a lot of daring direction  the film had no trouble keeping me spellbound from start to finish Recommended to all moviegoers in the original version to have a good laugh with  Abdul   Moritz Bleibtreu is absolutely awesome like a half brother of Vincent Vega ,3.5,LadySasori

158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, Sometimes it s bizarre when you step into another culture s  thing  without being able to fully understand it or quite why it appeals to the extent it does This German made film was a reasonably big deal over there  and did wonders for writer star  and uncredited co director  Til Schweiger s career  but it REALLY took off in   of all places   Russia  It won multiple awards over there and seems to be regarded by many Russians as being one of the greatest films of all time  just look on IMDB and most of the 10 10 reviews are from Russians  It s a cultural phenomenon over there  I ve tried looking into why this is   one IMDB reviewer posits that it s either the fact it was screened on TV in 1999  possibly a rare thing for a film like this  or the fact that it just has a very  Russian  sense of humour  Which is weird for a German movie  But it s a big thing  It s also had a Japanese remake made of it   so yeah  It resonates in certain places  for sure Still  despite making this splash in other cultures  it s never been released officially at all in the UK nor  to the best of my knowledge  in the US  Maybe it s because native English speaking audiences already have their own Quentin Tarantino  I don t know  This certainly takes its cues from him  from the Reservoir Dogs suits to actually having a brothel in the movie called True Romance  but is admittedly different in tone  Nowhere near as  edgy  There s a lot of shooting but hardly anyone gets really hurt The plot concerns two men  Til Schweiger and Jan Josef Liefers  who find that they have terminal cancer and very little time left  They are put in the same hospital ward and decide  after finding an inexplicable tequila stash in one of the cupboards  that they re going to go see the ocean  Because the ocean is what everyone in Heaven talks about  apparently  Once they break out and steal a car  they realise that actually  it doesn t matter what they do since they only have days to live  so they rob a gas station  then a bank and then find   to their surprise   that there s already 1 million Deutschmarks in the trunk of the car because  little did they know  they ve stolen it from one of the biggest crime lords in Germany  Chase hijinx ensue It s an entertaining and enjoyable caper with a couple of funny scenes  a lot of action and an inevitably poignant end  but I don t know  I think there is something I am missing that other viewers  particularly Russian ones it seems  get but this was definitely just an  easy watch  rather than a great film for me  There s also an uncomfortable sexism running through it   nothing too explicit but an undercurrent that was kinda tiresome  Although it s possible I just missed some nuance of the humour  Still  the lead performances are great and there s some understated but effective photography  But I wish someone could explain exactly what the big appeal is ,2.5,CJ
158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, Knockin  on Heavens Door hat wirklich d mliche Momente  beispielsweise k nnen deutsche Polizisten und stereotypische Gangster schlechter Pistolen bedienen als Stormtrooper  Darauf kommt es aber gar nicht an  Man kann sich  ber diese Aspekte echauffieren  doch der Kernaspekt des Filmes  die Freundschaft zwischen Martin und Rudi  funktioniert perfekt  Die Actionszenen sind zwar absolut unlogisch  daf r machen sie jedoch unendlich viel Spa  Die Hommagen an Quentin Tarantino bleiben genauso im Ged chtnis  Insgesamt f hlt man sich  ber die 87 Minuten sehr gut unterhalten  was ebenfalls daran liegt  dass Knockin  on Heavens Door nicht nur lustig ist  sondern zugleich auch ernste Momente bietet  bei denen das schallende Gel chter durchaus verstummt Vor allem Til Schweiger beweist eine super starke schauspielerische Leistung  seine Krampfanf lle schocken einen immer wieder bis ins Mark  So muss man am Ende vielleicht doch schlucken  weil es eben nicht nur ein Happy End ist Thomas Jahns Knockin  on Heavens Door war nicht revolution r und bietet sicherlich einige Altersflecken   dies mindert trotzdem zu keiner Sekunde die perfekte Unterhaltung  Das ist guter deutscher Film  Es muss nicht immer hoch intellektuell sein  manchmal reicht eine gut geschriebene Freundschaft und eine tragische Pr misse aus ,4.0,The Black Lodge
158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, Starring  The Wicked  Charming  Dutch Icon Rutger HauerOnce again  we come upon a film that is difficult to categorize as a Rutger Hauer film because the actor appears for less than five minutes That being said  this was a nice film with a fairly original premise about two terminally ill men who resolve to spend the rest of their lives pondering the beauty of the sea  One day while still drunk and dressed in their PJs  they decide to embark on a road trip to the sea by stealing a car  Unfortunately  the car belongs to a crime boss  thus their trip of rediscovery will be fraught with persecution  death  thefts  and other surprises The two leads give excellent performances  especially considering the type of film it is  The picture incorporates elements  directly or indirectly  of Tarantino s work with those of the very stylish and slick European wave  popularized by filmmakers such as Luc Bresson  Tom Tykwer  and later on Edgar Wright  among others  I also enjoyed the snappy editing and dialogue  You also got the nearly mandatory voice overs  Even the score  which adds to the film s overall coolness  is pretty solid All in all  although fairly derivative and somewhat messy  if you enjoy this style of 90s heist comedy  you ll have a nice time with this one TODAY SCHEDULEKnockin  on Heaven s DoorThe Call of the Wild  Dog of the YukonBleedersI Love You Too,3.5,"Rafael ""Parker!!""

158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, It wasn t thanks to Letterboxd or IMDB or any Facebook group that I found this film  but thanks to the site Rate Your Music that looking for the actor Til Schweiger in the web searching from another different film I saw that this one has a good rating on the site and is also considered one of the 150 films made in 1997  So I was curious to know what was so special about it This film from Germany tells us about two terminally ill young guys who dedicate themselves to live their last days with intensity and madness  skipping all the rules  The story is a unique combination of drama and comedy and presents some very crazy situations that provoke laughter  Even though the innermost longings of the protagonists are revealed to be limited  At the same time  two thugs  by the way  one of them is the actor Moritz Bleibtreu  famous for appearing in the mythical cult films Run  Lola Run  and The Experiment  are asked to deliver a car with an important package inside  The sick young men decide to escape from the medical center and happen to steal the thugs  car  parked in the parking lot  In addition  in their last days  they start an accelerated criminal career giving them all the same and getting money for their last wishes What at first seems to be introduced as a typical American crime comedy ends up becoming  after a few seconds  a drama marked by the Carpe Diem philosophy  Director Thomas Jahn plays with both genres  shooting from cops respecting traffic rules in the middle of a chase to one of the main characters crying for fear of death  A film that goes from the absurd to the sentimental constantly  and keeps the viewer hooked by its plot Although it manages to make you forget for a moment the seriousness and drama of the situation  you know that in the end both the characters and the viewer will have to face it  when that moment arrives it does not disappoint and manages to move  Knockin  on Heaven s Door is a fun  funny  and entertaining film  with two protagonists who are neither the good guys nor the bad guys of the story  immersed in a personal situation that does not give rise to moral judgments about their actions  they simply have a goal and do not hesitate at any time to reach it  which will make them get into one mess after another until the end of the film that although it can be quite predictable and does not give rise to surprises  no doubt it is a very sad ending Undoubtedly this film is quite unknown  and the appearances of Schweiger in what this could be his best starring role takes on the role of Martin  the more impulsive and thuggish patient of the two  Jan Josef Liefers  on the other hand  plays Rudy  an orderly and impressionable man  and there is no doubt that the leading couple has chemistry  in good times and in bad  Their adventures  dressed in eighties clothes  take them to the countryside  five star hotels  tailor shops  brothels  etc  Well  scenarios of all kinds  which may be simple for more than one due to its lack of details but do not end up being so badly achieved  The plot is the strongest point of this work and it is also interesting to see that several of the dialogues revolve around giving allegories to the ocean  it gives the feeling that both Jahn and Schweiger  who were the screenwriters of the film  are lovers of coastal landscapes full of sea  Many phrases are also loaded with religious meaning  and Martin assures that whoever does not get to see the blue landscape ends up being ignorant in the afterlife  In the dramatic moments  there are also several rhetorical figures  In the sky  they only talk about it  about the ocean  about the sunset  about how fucking wonderful it is to see that big ball of fire melt  Overall  we are talking about a coherent script  beautiful and  at certain moments  full of comic humor In short  an exciting  energetic  funny  and cinematic narration  A film with some technical errors  which cannot be denied  but within all this it is interesting from start to finish  The message it gives us is very inspiring as it tells us that at all times we must give importance to take advantage of life and not think or worry about what might happen tomorrow but savor the moment  it is also full of hope and optimism to those who can no longer escape death because it gives them calm and peace by addressing it in the most enjoyable way possible Knockin  on Heaven s Door is a solid road movie that mixes drama and comedy with a touching ending  We are talking about a film whose shots  photography  and scenery cannot be compared to a Hollywood or big budget production  but they don t need to because it will not leave anyone indifferent ,4.0,Mario Melendez
158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, Knockin  on Heaven s Door is a fun German fugitive movie that was obviously influenced by a certain Tarantino movie  The action plays out a bit clich d at times but it is really the relationship between Til Schweiger and Jan Josef Liefers that keeps you invested  Schweiger showcases his acting capabilities and pretty much out performs everyone here  Many Belgian and Dutch actors  Rutger Hauer  star in addition to the German ones  This has a great emotional payoff ,3.5,Lou (rhymes with wow!)

158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, Mama take this Badge from meI can t use it anymore It s getting dark too dark to see Feels like I m knockin on heavens doorHell what a ride One of the best German movies I ve ever seen  But absolutely the most enjoyable ever  Winnetou outstanding What a partnership of Schweiger and Liefers here  totally amazing  And at the same time sad to see what Schweiger does today  The best performance I ve seen from him with inglorious basterds  Bleibtreu and van werveke in also amazing supporting roles  sometimes a bit too much stupidness but all in all enjoyable characters   Rutgers Hauer with a very Short role but nice to see Roy batty again  D   So the story is the best   Action funny crime and emotional what you want more   The end is just perfect with bob Dylan because I waited the whole movie for that like in stand by me  I think totally like Quentin that music and film walks hand in hand So I know at some day this will probably a 4 star movie but not today  4 5 and thus nearly in a league with das Leben der anderen und das Boot my two fav German movies ever winnetou outstanding  But more for this in a German movie ranking in some years  D,4.5,ClinTarantino
158,Knockin' on Heaven's Door,1997, Knockin  on Heaven s Door  from its original title  is a German comedy drama which apparently crossed the border in general indifference and which I would never have heard of if it had not been recommended to me   Thanks a lot to  Stephan74 Apparently  the film is something of a phenomenon in Russia where its big hearted gangster theme resonated with local audiences  but it went completely unnoticed at home  The story is about very contrasting characters who end up liking and relying on each other  It s a story of friendship  told with great sincerity  and the alternation of comedy and drama gives it an original dynamic It s also a comedy  therefore  with a lot of gunfights  gangsters  and scenes that follow one another like little independent stories or sketches  based either on visual humor or on dialogue  The rhythm reminded me a lot of Tarantino s style  and particularly  True Romance   which he wrote without directing it  or  Pulp Fiction  but also that of Wright s  Hot Fuzz  and Scott s  Thelma and Louise   With its effective script  a lot of heart and a lot of daring direction  the film had no trouble keeping me spellbound from start to finish Recommended to all moviegoers in the original version to have a good laugh with  Abdul   Moritz Bleibtreu is absolutely awesome like a half brother of Vincent Vega ,3.5,LadySasori

27381,Innocent Blood,1992, Spooky Scary Horrorthons 6   Film  33  Bonus Film  2 It s funny how John Landis waited for 11 years after putting out his subgenre defining werewolf flick An Ameircan Werewolf in London to put out a vampire film that is anything but subgenre defining for the vampire flick  But that doesn t stop it from being an hilarious romp with a vampiric Robert Loggia who chews the scenery before sucking it dry of any leftover blood The setup here is an hilariously generic mobster story that just happens to find itself invaded by a young  attractive vampire with a foreign accent  One of her feeding sessions happens to involve a mobster boss  the earlier mentioned Robert Loggia  That particular feeding session turn out to be hectic  So hectic in fact that the vampire doesn t have time to  clean up  after her meal  And thus we re blessed with Robert Loggia as a vampiric mafia boss  I loved the fact that he became a much nicer boss to his goons when he became a vampire  since killing people as a vampire tends to lead to things other than cruel  instant death  The amusing onslaught of vampire mayhem that unfolds as Loggia keeps indulging in his newfound powers are stylish  bloody and most importantly  hilarious There were these constant shots of televisions that screened various horror films and also we are given a handful of cameos by various horror directors  These small  cute details keep you in the mindset that this film ultimately aims to be simple  unapologetic fun  And indeed it manages to be fun  especially when Robert Loggia shows up  I found it a bit peculiar however that the original vampire takes such a massive backseat after a while and kinda just wither away in some uninspired romance plot with this undercover cop guy which I guess is some sort of main protagonist  He is kind of boring  especially compared to some of the more intense performance that can be found In the end  this was loads of fun  Clearly John Landis just wanted to do a mafia film with a fucking vampire in it and boy did he ever do that ,4.0,Robert Berlin
27381,Innocent Blood,1992, Doesn t do for vampires what American Werewolf did for werewolves  Innocent Blood tries hard but comes off as more of an interesting mess than anything else  The film is basically a melding of gangster and vampire genres  though both are done rather basically and the two aspects of the plot never really blend together  There s no real plot as such   with the story just sort of playing out as a result of the lead character  This does make it difficult to predict where it s going to go but it also means the film lacks any real structure  It s overlong too  and there are stretches where nothing particularly interesting happens  On the other hand  the film does have some good ideas up its sleeve and there s plenty of blood too  The cast features a number of well known faces  with Robert Loggia being the main standout  Innocent Blood pays tributes to a number of low budget horror films by showing various characters watching them on TV  There s also interesting cameos for the likes of Sam Raimi  Dario Argento and Linnea Quigley  Overall  it s not terrible but it s not great either ,3.0,Slig001

est  um autor em um filme  Ou  neste caso  o autor deste filme Uma coisa que Landis entendeu muito bem sobre o cinema hollywoodiano  entre in meras outras coisas que entendeu magnificamente bem  mais do que o Friedkin  e melhor nem falar do Tarantino    que esse cinema teve como premissa um modelo de narra o impessoal no qual o que h  de mais interessante   o recuo  o recato  o sil ncio do autor

que modera o m ximo poss vel a sua presen a  que se resguarda de ter uma voz que n o seja e que n o venha da pr pria narrativa    levado a trabalhar no eufemismo Mas como trabalhar com o eufemismo num

27381,Innocent Blood,1992, What a cast of characters in this vampire gangster buddy cop film  It s almost a Sopranos casting call  Robert Loggia is a madman  Kind of like Landis doing an American werewolf in London  but with vampires and not in London  and not as good  Still  it s s fun time  and Robert Loggia really does elevate whatever he s in ,3.0,Ian West

27381,Innocent Blood,1992, A genuine slobberknocker in every respect  from its melding of undercover cop thriller  mob drama  and vampire horror genres  to its totally outrageous seconds from CGI deluge visual effects  I doubt if John Landis will be on anyone s lists of radical feminist filmmakers  but this is also a pretty interesting twist on gender and power dynamics  placing a powerful female vampire in an extremely macho  male dominated world   an entire term paper could probably be written about the use of handcuffs in the sex scene alone  Feels a bit like a studio cut mess  although I have no idea if that s what happened  particularly since Angela Bassett is only in two brief scenes  but it s the kind of ride you just can t get from movies anymore On Landis  I had the pleasure of watching this  along with Island of Lost Souls and Jekyll  amp  Hyde  with him in attendance  and he showed himself to be an extremely funny and passionate movie lover with a seemingly bottomless oratorical well of anecdotes  quotations  and digressions at his disposal  This was a great movie to watch under those conditions  since one gets a feel for how his personality is reflected in the movie  perhaps never more so than early on when Chazz Palminteri pauses during a tense Mafia exchange to watch The Beast From 20 000 Fathoms eat a guy on TV  adding his own commentary afterwards   I love that ,4.0,Joe
27381,Innocent Blood,1992, Have I got a Vampire film for you What you re not interested What if I throw in the femme fatale Anne Parillaud from the film La Femme Nikita as the demure blood sucking vamp Marie Still not convinced eh What if I throw some Gangster mayhem into the mix Man oh man you are one tough customer What if I throw in some gratuitous nudity  gore and the best death by sunlight scene ever Still not enough eh  Ok I m going for broke here  How about Cameo appearances by horror icons Dario Argento  Sam Raimi  and Tom Savini ,4.0,Naughty aka Juli Norwood
27381,Innocent Blood,1992, This really pleasurable mashup s fundamental flaw is that it s not particularly exciting  It s funny  it s got a stacked cast  it s full of outstanding practical VFX  it s occasionally weirdly pervy  and Landis  patented breezy but not impatient pace is as charming as ever  But it s a little too busy chuckling to itself and lacking some real jeopardy  as opposed to  say AMERICAN WEREWOLF  to which it s both unfair and impossible not to compare this ,3.5,matt lynch

27381,Innocent Blood,1992, boxd it i69681990s Vampires   Hoop9I saw this in 1993 but had only an emotional memory that it was pretty good  On revisit  I realize that it was  pretty good  for its time and context but has not held up so well  IMO John Landis melds the gangster horror genres and it has some shining moments  Exotic Anne Parillaud  La Femme Nikita  is our vampire and Anthony LaPaglia is a good cop  Things start out with a bang but  for some reason  the pace sags and scenes begin to drag on too long  so the film could have benefitted from a tougher editor  Still  it s plenty agreeable and Landis fills it with references to classic horror films and interesting supporting players such as Don Rickles  Chazz Palminteri and especially Robert Loggia  who has a blast as the evil antagonist Favorite scene  when Parillaud s character is having sex with LaPaglia  her eyes change colors four times  Cool  The tone is breezy and there is some humor to be had  Still  I can t give this a strong rec but it s far from a waste of time ,3.0,julianblair
27381,Innocent Blood,1992, Spooky Scary Horrorthons 6   Film  33  Bonus Film  2 It s funny how John Landis waited for 11 years after putting out his subgenre defining werewolf flick An Ameircan Werewolf in London to put out a vampire film that is anything but subgenre defining for the vampire flick  But that doesn t stop it from being an hilarious romp with a vampiric Robert Loggia who chews the scenery before sucking it dry of any leftover blood The setup here is an hilariously generic mobster story that just happens to find itself invaded by a young  attractive vampire with a foreign accent  One of her feeding sessions happens to involve a mobster boss  the earlier mentioned Robert Loggia  That particular feeding session turn out to be hectic  So hectic in fact that the vampire doesn t have time to  clean up  after her meal  And thus we re blessed with Robert Loggia as a vampiric mafia boss  I loved the fact that he became a much nicer boss to his goons when he became a vampire  since killing people as a vampire tends to lead to things other than cruel  instant death  The amusing onslaught of vampire mayhem that unfolds as Loggia keeps indulging in his newfound powers are stylish  bloody and most importantly  hilarious There were these constant shots of televisions that screened various horror films and also we are given a handful of cameos by various horror directors  These small  cute details keep you in the mindset that this film ultimately aims to be simple  unapologetic fun  And indeed it manages to be fun  especially when Robert Loggia shows up  I found it a bit peculiar however that the original vampire takes such a massive backseat after a while and kinda just wither away in some uninspired romance plot with this undercover cop guy which I guess is some sort of main protagonist  He is kind of boring  especially compared to some of the more intense performance that can be found In the end  this was loads of fun  Clearly John Landis just wanted to do a mafia film with a fucking vampire in it and boy did he ever do that ,4.0,Robert Berlin
27381,Innocent Blood,1992, Doesn t do for vampires what American Werewolf did for werewolves  Innocent Blood tries hard but comes off as more of an interesting mess than anything else  The film is basically a melding of gangster and vampire genres  though both are done rather basically and the two aspects of the plot never really blend together  There s no real plot as such   with the story just sort of playing out as a result of the lead character  This does make it difficult to predict where it s going to go but it also means the film lacks any real structure  It s overlong too  and there are stretches where nothing particularly interesting happens  On the other hand  the film does have some good ideas up its sleeve and there s plenty of blood too  The cast features a number of well known faces  with Robert Loggia being the main standout  Innocent Blood pays tributes to a number of low budget horror films by showing various characters watching them on TV  There s also interesting cameos for the likes of Sam Raimi  Dario Argento and Linnea Quigley  Overall  it s not terrible but it s not great either ,3.0,Slig001

est  um autor em um filme  Ou  neste caso  o autor deste filme Uma coisa que Landis entendeu muito bem sobre o cinema hollywoodiano  entre in meras outras coisas que entendeu magnificamente bem  mais do que o Friedkin  e melhor nem falar do Tarantino    que esse cinema teve como premissa um modelo de narra o impessoal no qual o que h  de mais interessante   o recuo  o recato  o sil ncio do autor  E tudo nesse cinema torna se ainda mais interessante quando essa presen a recatada do autor  do narrador  essa presen a moderada que tamb m pode ser chamada de retic ncia  discri o  e at  mesmo em alguns filmes  os de Preminger  os de Tourneur  alguns do Siodmak  de segredo e mist rio   tudo nesse cinema  em resumo  torna se ainda mais interessante quando o autor  o narrador se apagam para dar

que modera o m ximo poss vel a sua presen a  que se resguarda de ter uma voz que n o seja e que n o venha da pr pria narrativa    levado a trabalhar no eufemismo Mas como trabalhar com o eufemismo num

28484,Colorado Territory,1949, Colorado Territory  is the remake that Warner Brothers tried to hide the heritage of   all so that they could mine one brilliant plot for twice the box office It s the type of money hungry ploy that would be familiar to the ageing outlaw protagonist of Raoul Walsh s  Territory    And also of Raoul Walsh s  High Sierra The director was so enamoured with the success of  Sierra  a 1941 Humphrey Bogart vehicle  that in 1948  Walsh pitched a retread of his own movie that simply moved the plot to a different mountain range  Warner Brothers  enamoured with profit  agreed to the offer The studio made no reference to  Sierra  in marketing  Territory  leaving audiences to draw any links between the two on their own   after paying for a ticket  And in a score for corporate greed and also solid filmmaking  the ploy worked Where  Sierra  was a Western Noir   Territory  is a Noir Western  The remake has all the cynicism of the original  but framed with the expansive doomed romanticism of the frontier Joel McCrea has the steepest uphill climb of the outing   needing to fill the shoes of the most iconic actor in Hollywood history  While Bogie takes majority stake of the pot for his charismatic fatalism  it s a different sort of shock to see McCrea s blond  football star looking frontiersman fall to such a bitter but inescapable end From West to East wood  Westerns Ranked,4.0,theriverjordan
28484,Colorado Territory,1949, I ve always found it funny why a director would remake one of his own films  only several years after the original  The two that immediately spring to mind are Hitchcock with his two versions of The Man Who Knew Too Much from 1934 and 1956  and Howard Hawks  El Dorado  1966  which was essentially a loose remake of his own Rio Bravo  1959  I hadn t been aware that Raoul Walsh s Colorado Territory was a remake of his own High Sierra from 1941  I d actually watched this one last week and forgotten to log it  so watched it again and loved it even more this time around  with both McCrea and Virginia Mayo absolutely brilliant here  giving this one a tragic romantic ending I didn t see coming  Joel McCrea plays Wes McQueen  an outlaw sprung from prison by an old friend who needs him for one last big train hold up  McQueen is grateful  but on the way to meet the man who arranged his escape  he meets a father and daughter on a stagecoach that he saves from a band of outlaws  He s quite taken with Julie Ann Winslow  Dorothy Malone  and her father  Fred  Henry Hull    who ve moved West after buying a ranch  and with McQueen using a pseudonym  Chet Rogers  they have no idea that he s a wanted man  On meeting with his old friend  who has a plan for a huge train robbery which will give both of them enough to retire  On his way to meet up with his new crew  he stops at the Winslow s ranch with a dress for Julie Ann  and money for her father to buy tools to dig a well  Wes is already thinking about what he ll do when he walks away from being an outlaw  and Julie Ann fits the bill for him  With McQueen agreeing to hook up with the other participants in a ghost town in the middle of nowhere  it s here he ll meet Virginia Mayo s Colorado Carson  Reno Blake  John Archer  and  Duke Harris  James Mitchell his partners in crime  He isn t impressed by the low life men  but Colorado is different  and there s a spark between them  one that ll flourish later  With the plan set  it s time for action  but what each of them think will happen is very different from the carnage during the robbery  which sees them set up and double crossing each other  before McQueen and Colorado make a daring escape  Chased by a posse  they have only one place to go  the Winslows  but will they find sanctuary there  or betrayal once McQueen s true identity is revealed  I haven t seen High Sierra  but if it is anywhere near as good as this  then I ll be adding it to my collection rather sharpish  It s a great story full of twists  revelations  and special performances from McCrea and Mayo  who sizzle onscreen together  I thought this did come with a shock ending too  but the way we got there was cinematic mastery from Raoul Walsh who really knew how to shoot a Western  Gunplay  stunts  incredible cinematography and camera angles  and a script I could invest in made this one of the finest Westerns I ve seen all year  I knew McCrea and Mayo s talents beforehand  suspected that Malone would deliver too  and in the likes of Henry Hull and Morris Ankrum  we had genuine Western experience in smaller roles  It looked glorious  my Italian Dvd did cost me a few quid last year  but it was worth it after I couldn t find a copy here in the UK  One that deserves a Blu Ray remastering from someone like Kino Lorber  Eureka  or Indicator  this one lived up to expectations and surpassed them ,4.5,Andy Summers ü§†
28484,Colorado Territory,1949, Many spoilers ahead  including some minor ones for High Sierra One of the best things about Raoul Walsh s High Sierra is the decided moral ambiguity of its lead character  Roy Earle  ferociously played by Humphrey Bogart  Earle is an outlaw by choice  and he lacks the tragic backstory that often acts as a shortcut to win such figures audience sympathy  In Walsh s 1949 remake  Colorado Territory  that central character undergoes significant changes at the expense of the murkiness at his core The first  and perhaps most important change is that  in place of Bogart   best known as a screen criminal when High Sierra was made   Walsh is now working with Joel McCrea  Wes McQueen  More than fifteen years into a very busy career by 1949  McCrea carried with him an air of wholesomeness on screen  a quality that the audiences would project onto his character whether or not he was intended to have it  With this casting choice  then  Walsh was making a decision  McQueen is going to be the good man that Earle only sometimes wished he could be  With McCrea in the role  the character s ambiguity is already diminished  and the story strips it away entirely  McQueen is an unwilling participant in the heist at the movie s center  and in pulling it off  he s betrayed and abandoned by three of the other four participants  He also not the triggerman here   indeed there is no killing at all  until the film s final confrontation   which means McQueen is never portrayed as someone unbothered by killing  In addition  he s tormented not only by the memory of a dead fianc e  Martha  but also by the betrayal of a woman  Julie Ann  played with a nasty edge by Dorothy Malone  who  we re told  he decided to love because of  her resemblance to the woman he d lost  In other words  he s the perfect receptacle for the audience s sympathy and support  and any of his questionable or less than loving behavior toward women   or  rather  toward one woman  Virginia Mayo s Colorado   is explained away by the pain of his loss McQueen s relationship with Colorado  too  is streamlined and purified in comparison to the one between Earle and Marie  Here  though McQueen pushes Colorado away at her first approach  claiming there s no space for her in his life   an action that directly mirrors Earle s behavior   he fairly quickly changes his mind  needing only Colorado s revelation about the connection between Julie Ann and Martha to realize that he might just have loved Colorado all along  There is no sense of the settling for her because she s there that comes from Earle in High Sierra  nor is there any indication that McQueen is more of an escape than a true love Colorado  something that appeared to be central to Marie s devotion in the earlier film  Indeed  in Colorado Territory  Colorado   after identifying herself as  Wes McQueen s woman    sacrifices herself for him in a final act of devotion that links them together  literally  via their positions in death  forever While it s my view that the changes to the central character render Colorado Territory inferior to High Sierra  the character of Colorado herself deserves examination  She s of mixed race  made offensively clear by the brownface makeup Mayo wears  a fact which  given that this is Hollywood  we can assume explains her hot temper and toughness  That said  however  she s undeniably a character who is portrayed positively   she s unstinting in her support for McQueen  and is even shown expressing a Catholic faith   and whose identity as someone with Indigenous blood is never mocked or portrayed as a negative  Further  to matter of factly present an interracial relationship when the great majority of American states had anti miscegenation laws on the books    including all of the west bar Washington  New Mexico  and Nebraska  and every state in the south  indeed 16 states in the south still enforced such laws in 1967 when the Supreme Court decision in Loving v Virginia declared them unconstitutional    is noteworthy and commendable  despite the vehicle of brownface that was used to do it Many thanks to  daniwiller87 for reminding me that I d been meaning to watch this  and prompting the comparison ,3.5,sakana1

28484,Colorado Territory,1949, March to the WestRaoul Walsh remakes re adapts High Sierra as a western  and it turns out the heist works just as well as a train robbery  You can t trust anybody in this awful  desperate  forgotten ghost town of a world  least of all the people closest to you  There are two kinds of people in this world  victims of fate who suffer the consequences of their hard destiny  and arbiters of fate who decide their own destiny and that of the other folks around them  These callous arbiters pull the strings while laying blame for the cruelty of their meddling on the twisted hands of fate   Well  that s how the cards fall  one such meddler excuses himself from responsibility after double crossing his friends and robbing his fallen comrades   This deck s had so much bottom dealing it s dog eared There s a Gift of the Magi type tragic irony to this cynical fatalism  In a world so horrible  the few folks who find other people they can trust tend to form strong attachments and are willing to sacrifice quite a lot for each other  but this ends up backfiring when both sides end up sacrificing the same thing  There s a certain pessimistic futility to grand gestures here  any gift worth giving requires a sizable sacrifice  and anyone worth giving a gift to is going to give something back in return  and this balancing of accounts often results in two people sacrificing themselves for each other  two corpses that gave their lives so that maybe they wouldn t have to die  1940s   Westerns   Film Noir,3.0,ScreeningNotes
28484,Colorado Territory,1949, Colorado Territory   WALSH    a couple of thoughts 1  I tend to consider Walsh at least the equal of Hawks Ford Hitchcock whomever else you want to put here  His rep suffers a bit because none of his films are especially well known  and so much of the early stuff is LOST  and the most  relatively  famous ones aren t necessarily the best of the best  Because of that  I get why people might scratch their heads when I talk about Walsh in such glowing terms  or refer to his work for Fox in the early 30s as being that of an American Renoir 2  However  I always thought EVERYBODY loved Joel McCrea  Recently I ve started to read stuff that isn t so much critical of him as it is writing from the point of view that he s some kind of minor actor who lucked into a few good movies  Maybe I ve been hanging out on the Dave Kehr blog too long  but has the take on McCrea changed among more mainstream cinephiles or have I always had it wrong   Anyway  McCrea is obviously great  I m only asking because I like to track who s  in  or  out  at any given time 3  When talking about a movie by a guy like Walsh  it s tempting  but dangerous  to talk as if he was implementing some kind of grand design through his filmmaking  because  a  I get the sense from reading his autobiography  amp  biography that he was working from instinct most of the time but  b  it really seems like the design is there  Not that  a  and  b  are mutually exclusive  but it s important to distinguish how Walsh  amp  his movies worked from the way  say  Bergman  amp  his movies work and not talk as if they re doing the same kind of things  even if both of them end up making Great Works of Cinematic Art  All of which is preface to 4  Walsh always seems to be reaching backwards  even as he s moving forward  Here  there are quite a few sequences shots that recall the style of silent filmmaking  I m thinking especially of the train heist  much of which is shot straight on from the side and the final trek through the canyons  but Walsh mixes it up with a number of striking changes in perspective that give us the feeling of suddenly being thrust INTO the movie  pulling the rug out from under us  These kinds of transitions are central to Walsh s art   and central to what the movie s about  the past catching up with you and forcing you to reassess what the present really looks like and what the future could hold 5  This is a great movie ,5.0,Jonathan Hastings

28484,Colorado Territory,1949, Raoul Walsh remakes High Sierra as a noir Western with Joel McCrae and Virginia Mayo in the Bogart and Lupino roles  No  it doesn t have quite the same pedigree  but the source material was good enough to have another go  The story beats are nearly identical  one last heist  a  bad  girl who s not  and a  good  girl who isn t  untrustworthy confederates  betrayal  revenge  a sharpshooter  and a slightly different ending  McCrae has a more disenchanted take than Bogart s blunt and quick tempered  Mad Dog  Earle  but both Mayo and McCrae are solid  as is the direction by Walsh  and the cinematography by Hickox ,4.0,Jim Morrow
28484,Colorado Territory,1949, Trolley s 2017 Watchlist  13 50 Well  don t get any ideas you are through with us  You wouldn t last long cut off from the herd  McQueen  You re branded clean to the bone   Harry Woods as Pluthner Over the years certain directors have sometimes remade their own films but the success rate has been pretty mixed  on the credit side there is Alfred Hitchcock with his James Stewart Doris Day starring remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much  1956  Yasujir  Ozu s beautiful Floating Weeds  1959  and Cecil B  DeMille s grandiose The Ten Commandments  1956  but on the debit side there are such misfires as George Sluizer s Hollywood remake of The Vanishing  1993    which deserved to vanish without trace   and Howard Hawks  misguided remake of Ball Of Fire  A Song Is Born  1948  which he admitted he only did for the  moolah Thankfully  Raoul Walsh s  reimagining    loathsome word    of his 1941 classic High Sierra to a Western setting sits firmly on the credit side of the fence The story fits perfectly into the Western setting and once you get over the shock of seeing Joel McCrea in the Humphrey Bogart part  this doom laden film quickly settles down into a fast paced and exciting drama which retains its  noir  credentials   helped immeasurably in this respect by Sid Hickox s beautiful black and white cinematography   with the hoary  ages old storyline of  bandit who wants to go straight after one last job  coming up fresh as a daisy in Raoul Walsh s experienced hands  and though you know where this tale is heading   even without having seen the earlier film you can probably guess the outcome   the sheer goddamn likability of McCrea as an actor and the dilemma faced by his character left me hoping for a Hollywood style happy ending I knew probably wasn t coming  the  bad  guy just has to get his comeuppance The supporting cast is strong  too  with Virginia Mayo in particular proving to be a surprisingly effective replacement for High Sierra s Ida Lupino as the tough cookie half breed saloon singer who stands side by side with McCrea as the story nears its climax  this is one of the finest performances I ve seen from an actress whose potential was first shown in William Wyler s The Best Years Of Our Lives  as the unfaithful wife of Dana Andrews  but then rarely capitalized on Trivia Note  The material was robust enough to support a third version made by Warner Brothers in 1955  this time under the title of I Died A Thousand Times and starring Jack Palance and Shelley Winters Online Access  ok ru video 1124355017218,4.0,trolleyfreak
28484,Colorado Territory,1949, High Sierra splendidly recast within an uncompromising  savage  desert landscape of sheer  austere cliffs and long abandoned Native American mesas and villages   a land of ghosts  where forlorn hopes only live on in those with the strongest faith  Beautifully shot by Sidney Wilcox  this is where Raoul Walsh advances on his tale of doomed gangsters and turns it into something more deeply spiritual and existential  In Joel McCrea  he fuses Humphrey Bogart with a sweet puppy  so McCrea s Wes McQueen never loses his integrity or his essential good nature  even when he is shooting a whole bunch of people  indeed  when McQueen finds his true feelings in Virginia Mayo s Colorado  he finds the place of his transcendence  the  Colorado Territory  where he achieves happiness ,4.0,Silversaxophone

28484,Colorado Territory,1949, Colorado Territory   WALSH    a couple of thoughts 1  I tend to consider Walsh at least the equal of Hawks Ford Hitchcock whomever else you want to put here  His rep suffers a bit because none of his films are especially well known  and so much of the early stuff is LOST  and the most  relatively  famous ones aren t necessarily the best of the best  Because of that  I get why people might scratch their heads when I talk about Walsh in such glowing terms  or refer to his work for Fox in the early 30s as being that of an American Renoir 2  However  I always thought EVERYBODY loved Joel McCrea  Recently I ve started to read stuff that isn t so much critical of him as it is writing from the point of view that he s some kind of minor actor who lucked into a few good movies  Maybe I ve been hanging out on the Dave Kehr blog too long  but has the take on McCrea changed among more mainstream cinephiles or have I always had it wrong   Anyway  McCrea is obviously great  I m only asking because I like to track who s  in  or  out  at any given time 3  When talking about a movie by a guy like Walsh  it s tempting  but dangerous  to talk as if he was implementing some kind of grand design through his filmmaking  because  a  I get the sense from reading his autobiography  amp  biography that he was working from instinct most of the time but  b  it really seems like the design is there  Not that  a  and  b  are mutually exclusive  but it s important to distinguish how Walsh  amp  his movies worked from the way  say  Bergman  amp  his movies work and not talk as if they re doing the same kind of things  even if both of them end up making Great Works of Cinematic Art  All of which is preface to 4  Walsh always seems to be reaching backwards  even as he s moving forward  Here  there are quite a few sequences shots that recall the style of silent filmmaking  I m thinking especially of the train heist  much of which is shot straight on from the side and the final trek through the canyons  but Walsh mixes it up with a number of striking changes in perspective that give us the feeling of suddenly being thrust INTO the movie  pulling the rug out from under us  These kinds of transitions are central to Walsh s art   and central to what the movie s about  the past catching up with you and forcing you to reassess what the present really looks like and what the future could hold 5  This is a great movie ,5.0,Jonathan Hastings

28484,Colorado Territory,1949, Raoul Walsh remakes High Sierra as a noir Western with Joel McCrae and Virginia Mayo in the Bogart and Lupino roles  No  it doesn t have quite the same pedigree  but the source material was good enough to have another go  The story beats are nearly identical  one last heist  a  bad  girl who s not  and a  good  girl who isn t  untrustworthy confederates  betrayal  revenge  a sharpshooter  and a slightly different ending  McCrae has a more disenchanted take than Bogart s blunt and quick tempered  Mad Dog  Earle  but both Mayo and McCrae are solid  as is the direction by Walsh  and the cinematography by Hickox ,4.0,Jim Morrow

28484,Colorado Territory,1949, High Sierra splendidly recast within an uncompromising  savage  desert landscape of sheer  austere cliffs and long abandoned Native American mesas and villages   a land of ghosts  where forlorn hopes only live on in those with the strongest faith  Beautifully shot by Sidney Wilcox  this is where Raoul Walsh advances on his tale of doomed gangsters and turns it into something more deeply spiritual and existential  In Joel McCrea  he fuses Humphrey Bogart with a sweet puppy  so McCrea s Wes McQueen never loses his integrity or his essential good nature  even when he is shooting a whole bunch of people  indeed  when McQueen finds his true feelings in Virginia Mayo s Colorado  he finds the place of his transcendence  the  Colorado Territory  where he achieves happiness ,4.0,Silversaxophone

99627,"East Side, West Side",1949, Spoilers ahead East Side  West Side is built upon two sets of jaggedly matched pairs  On one hand  we have Jessie  Barbara Stanwyck  and Brandon Bourne  James Mason  they are the liars  On the other  we have the truth tellers  Mark Dwyer  Van Heflin  and Isabel Lorrison  Ava Gardner  Though the duos superficially align  their motives and attitudes differ wildly  and it s those differences that  I think  give the movie much of its power and complexity JESSIEJessie lies because telling the truth just isn t done  She s a lady of society  and with that come responsibilities big and small  The household is hers to run  and if that work isn t done so smoothly as to be invisible  she has failed  both as a wife and as a woman  Her feelings  concerns  and experiences are irrelevant before her duties in the home  And she must care for her husband  fulfilling what Adlai Stevenson would later describe as her duty  to keep him truly purposeful  to keep him whole  Having grown up in a home that  to her  felt full of drama   something she blamed  blames  entirely on her mother   Jessie has come to believe that being a good wife means keeping quiet  Means never telling the truth  at least not about things that matter  So of course she didn t confront Brandon about his affair   the mere thought makes her shudder  She saw her father being apologetic  and felt it was a failure on her mother s part  so she s made it her goal never to make her husband uncomfortable  no matter what he does to her  how he makes her feel The ease with which Jessie has learned to live in her lies is apparent when she and Helen finally speak frankly  about things that are real  It s hard for Jessie to even get the words out  so unfamiliar is she with sharing her feelings  with telling another person what she s experienced  Because  of course  there are appearances to keep up  parties to attend  with or without her husband  and happiness to feign and excuses to make when he s not there  Warm smiles to distribute in order to maintain friendships   connections   hands to be pressed in acknowledgement of status And so this is what her marriage has become  literally no one to turn to  anywhere  to talk to about what she s going through  No one with whom she can share her pain  her fear  her rage  Not a single person who can tell her that what she s feeling is right  and good  and wise  Every time she opens her mouth about anything that matters  she lies  and another little piece of her soul crumbles away BRANDONBrandon lies because can  Because he s of the class and the gender that make the rules  and around whom society orbits  Because no one has ever challenged anything he s done or said  and eventually his lies just became the truth  His world mirrors his home  full of people and places bending over backward to ensure his comfort  going out of their ways to keep him content  Women  men  institutions   they re all unfailingly accommodating of Brandon s wishes and Brandon s lies It might not make Brandon happy  this easy drifting through life  cushioned by the closed eyes  understanding nods  and conspiratorial winks  but it makes him comfortable  and comfort is most of what he wants  And so he fucks around on his wife  gets what he craves  while everyone looks the other way  and his wife welcomes him home with a polite kiss on the cheek  and they settle down for another nice  comfortable dinner ISABELIsabel tells the truth because it s disruptive  because it shakes up the placid waters through which Brandon and people like him are accustomed to sailing  Her truths are intentionally raw and honest  and crammed with things that Are Just Not Said  She loves to shock the blueblood world she now inhabits  both to see their horror and  perhaps even more deliciously  to watch them try to smooth over her offenses with polite  proper conversation  spoken through clenched jaws  all the while trying to destroy her with the ferocity of their glares  Loves to tell women that their husbands are at her beck and call  and watch them try to be strong as she looks them in the eye and dares them to tell her she s wrong And Isabel tells the truth because she s learned to say things out loud before other people have a chance to say them  You ll never get to call her a slut  oh no  not anymore  Now  she ll tell you herself  loudly  or simply agree with you  all with the sweetest of smiles on her face  and heat in her eyes that makes you forget you re in public  And she ll proudly label herself cheap  and dirty  and forward  because it s all true  sometimes  and because it doesn t hurt  hurts less  when she s the one saying it MARKIn many ways  Mark is Jessie s opposite  Whereas it s become second nature for her to ignore and repress her feelings  Mark has learned to frankly examine and externalize them  for better or for worse  He tells the truth because of  time  which  he says   I don t have much of  He doesn t want to waste his limited time   or that of anyone else   with lies or obfuscation  For Mark  there s no longer any choice but to be truthful  And Mark tells the truth because he can see truths in others  whether or not they speak them  Because he   maybe he alone  within the world of East Side  West Side   looks past words  seeing the people and feelings behind them  So he knows instantly that Jessie is falling apart  even as no one else even notices she is upset  And he knows right away who Brandon is  after meeting him once  He speaks based on the truths he knows  based on the things other people won t say out loud  And it bothers people  the same way Isabel s truths do  But whereas Isabel wants to shock   lives for the reactions she gets   Mark tells the truth in spite of them Perhaps the most important thing about Mark  though  is that  when he cannot find the truth on his own  he asks  Again  unlike anyone else in the world into which he s dropped when he returns home from Europe  Mark wants to know  wants to understand  And so he peppers Jessie with questions  evincing a curiosity so sincere it makes her uncomfortable  It s so foreign to her experience that she instinctively pushes back  assuming something inappropriate is being done  And  in a way  Jessie is right   in her world  curiosity is forbidden  because it undermines the polite looking away  and the vast network of lies that define her class and her life   By the time their relationship ends  Jessie wishes there was time   always  the need for more time   for Mark to ask more questions  to evince her truth It s hard to know what  exactly  to take from all this  It feels facile to say that the truth tellers shine lights on flaws that otherwise are ignored  because it s more complicated than that  Were the flaws between Jessie and Brandon there before Isabel arrived with her destructive  alluring truths  Was she illuminating the cracks  or creating them  Or was she doing a bit of both  Would Jessie have left Brandon without Mark s quiet  generous speaking and seeking of truth  Can we really know what impact his voice and actions had on her life and her choices Ultimately  perhaps  seeking an answer here is unsatisfying  but the lingering questions serve to highlight the film s steadfast refusal to engage in oversimplification  either of individuals or relationships ,4.5,sakana1

99627,"East Side, West Side",1949, Very enjoyable melodrama that knows just what to do with the varied talents of Stanwyck  Gardner  Mason and Heflin You can tell it comes from a book and one that presumably made a lot more of the social ups and downs of Stanwyck s characters life  the film periodically brings in references to her in relationship to the various sections of manhattan that give the film it s name but they don t really stick in the transition to 110 minute movie  Either that or 1949 wasn t the time for full on class consciousness even from writers who were fully paid cup card carrying communists  But what it loses in detailed characterisation and what felt like a very compressed story it gained in it s use of actors  Stanwyck and Mason don t have much chemistry together  they never quite make the marriage at the centre of the story seem like something worth fighting over and the story also doesn t quite make it explicitly something to escape  so you don t get full on possessive Mason  Instead you get vain and weak little boy Mason but he s great at that too and it s a charming odious performance wonderfully summed up by Stanwyck s mother in a final scene  stanwyck is of course great  with Cyd Charisse  another character who came across as being more important in the source material not that i know that for sure  but especially with Van Heflin  Their scenes together resonate with that elusive grown up sexuality and spark that Stanwyck did so well through the late 40s and 50s and he really impressed in his scenes opposite her  you do for all the corniness of the classic 40s womans picture really invest in them even 60 plus years on It s not a very top drawer Stanwyck picture or performance but everyone involved clearly knows what it has in her and how to support it and thats a guaranteed great way to spend a few hours ,4.0,Owen

99627,"East Side, West Side",1949, Yes  this is my town  It s not new to you  You ve read books about it  you ve seen movies  People are always talking about New York  It s the most exciting city in the world  they say  the most glamorous  the most frightening and above all  the fastest  You hear a great deal about the tempo of this city  its speed  its pace  its driving heartbeat  Perhaps it s true   for visitors  But I was born here  I live here  And the only pace I know is the pace of my own life  The only beat I hear is the beat of my own heart  For me and for millions of others  New York is home  The days follow each other quietly  as they do in most places  Only rarely does any one time stand out so that we remember it and say  That s when everything changed  after that nothing was the same  There was a time like that in my life  three days  I remember a summer evening in Gramercy Park When I was a kid  I was always obsessed with book and VHS covers  Repeatedly I borrowed a a paperback copy of Daphne du Maurier s Rebecca from the Dyker branch of the Brooklyn Public Library  of course I was never going to read it since I was probably seven or eight years old  but I loved staring at the combination of color  font and texture  I felt the same way about my mom s tape of East Side  West Side  the front of which depicted an image of James Mason and Ava Gardner locked in a passionate embrace  while the back showed Gardner in a sexy strapless gown designed by Helen Rose  Unlike the Rebecca novel  though  I could watch Mervyn LeRoy s film at a young age  aware that these actors were some of the finest available in Hollywood circa 1949 and that there can be gloriously soap operatic entertainment in the extravagant lives of Manhattan s upper crust I m positive that ESWS contributed to my early development as a Barbara Stanwyck stan  but also Van Heflin is so wonderful   Well  aside from that one moment  if you ve seen it  you know what it is  Moreover  I love seeing Cyd Charisse  Gale Sondergaard  even though it s totally bizarre that she plays Stanwyck s mother  William Conrad  Raymond Greenleaf  Beverly Michaels  who was married to the film s producer  the excellently named Voldemar Vetluguin  at the time  William Frawley  Tom Powers  Lou Lubin and Paula Raymond in the tremendous supporting cast of MGM players  Even future First Lady Nancy  Davis  Reagan is in there as one of Stanwyck s best friends  Isobel Lennart s screenplay of Marcia Davenport s novel offers romantic melodrama  interesting friendships between women  a lush score courtesy of Mikl s R zsa  I detect a noticeable resemblance to his sweeping Spellbound music  and a third act twist into another genre that heightens the spectacle even further and really needs to be seen to be believed  At one point James Mason smashes his hand through a glass partition  The sheer intensity of it all  For other viewers  East Side  West Side may not appear to be a five star film  but to my eyes and ears it always will be The Films of Barbara Stanwyck  Ranked  So Far ,5.0,theironcupcake
99627,"East Side, West Side",1949, Spoilers ahead East Side  West Side is built upon two sets of jaggedly matched pairs  On one hand  we have Jessie  Barbara Stanwyck  and Brandon Bourne  James Mason  they are the liars  On the other  we have the truth tellers  Mark Dwyer  Van Heflin  and Isabel Lorrison  Ava Gardner  Though the duos superficially align  their motives and attitudes differ wildly  and it s those differences that  I think  give the movie much of its power and complexity JESSIEJessie lies because telling the truth just isn t done  She s a lady of society  and with that come responsibilities big and small  The household is hers to run  and if that work isn t done so smoothly as to be invisible  she has failed  both as a wife and as a woman  Her feelings  concerns  and experiences are irrelevant before her duties in the home  And she must care for her husband  fulfilling what Adlai Stevenson would later describe as her duty  to keep him truly purposeful  to keep him whole  Having grown up in a home that  to her  felt full of drama   something she blamed  blames  entirely on her mother   Jessie has come to believe that being a good wife means keeping quiet  Means never telling the truth  at least not about things that matter  So of course she didn t confront Brandon about his affair   the mere thought makes her shudder  She saw her father being apologetic  and felt it was a failure on her mother s part  so she s made it her goal never to make her husband uncomfortable  no matter what he does to her  how he makes her feel The ease with which Jessie has learned to live in her lies is apparent when she and Helen finally speak frankly  about things that are real  It s hard for Jessie to even get the words out  so unfamiliar is she with sharing her feelings  with telling another person what she s experienced  Because  of course  there are appearances to keep up  parties to attend  with or without her husband  and happiness to feign and excuses to make when he s not there  Warm smiles to distribute in order to maintain friendships   connections   hands to be pressed in acknowledgement of status And so this is what her marriage has become  literally no one to turn to  anywhere  to talk to about what she s going through  No one with whom she can share her pain  her fear  her rage  Not a single person who can tell her that what she s feeling is right  and good  and wise  Every time she opens her mouth about anything that matters  she lies  and another little piece of her soul crumbles away BRANDONBrandon lies because can  Because he s of the class and the gender that make the rules  and around whom society orbits  Because no one has ever challenged anything he s done or said  and eventually his lies just became the truth  His world mirrors his home  full of people and places bending over backward to ensure his comfort  going out of their ways to keep him content  Women  men  institutions   they re all unfailingly accommodating of Brandon s wishes and Brandon s lies It might not make Brandon happy  this easy drifting through life  cushioned by the closed eyes  understanding nods  and conspiratorial winks  but it makes him comfortable  and comfort is most of what he wants  And so he fucks around on his wife  gets what he craves  while everyone looks the other way  and his wife welcomes him home with a polite kiss on the cheek  and they settle down for another nice  comfortable dinner ISABELIsabel tells the truth because it s disruptive  because it shakes up the placid waters through which Brandon and people like him are accustomed to sailing  Her truths are intentionally raw and honest  and crammed with things that Are Just Not Said  She loves to shock the blueblood world she now inhabits  both to see their horror and  perhaps even more deliciously  to watch them try to smooth over her offenses with polite  proper conversation  spoken through clenched jaws  all the while trying to destroy her with the ferocity of their glares  Loves to tell women that their husbands are at her beck and call  and watch them try to be strong as she looks them in the eye and dares them to tell her she s wrong And Isabel tells the truth because she s learned to say things out loud before other people have a chance to say them  You ll never get to call her a slut  oh no  not anymore  Now  she ll tell you herself  loudly  or simply agree with you  all with the sweetest of smiles on her face  and heat in her eyes that makes you forget you re in public  And she ll proudly label herself cheap  and dirty  and forward  because it s all true  sometimes  and because it doesn t hurt  hurts less  when she s the one saying it MARKIn many ways  Mark is Jessie s opposite  Whereas it s become second nature for her to ignore and repress her feelings  Mark has learned to frankly examine and externalize them  for better or for worse  He tells the truth because of  time  which  he says   I don t have much of  He doesn t want to waste his limited time   or that of anyone else   with lies or obfuscation  For Mark  there s no longer any choice but to be truthful  And Mark tells the truth because he can see truths in others  whether or not they speak them  Because he   maybe he alone  within the world of East Side  West Side   looks past words  seeing the people and feelings behind them  So he knows instantly that Jessie is falling apart  even as no one else even notices she is upset  And he knows right away who Brandon is  after meeting him once  He speaks based on the truths he knows  based on the things other people won t say out loud  And it bothers people  the same way Isabel s truths do  But whereas Isabel wants to shock   lives for the reactions she gets   Mark tells the truth in spite of them Perhaps the most important thing about Mark  though  is that  when he cannot find the truth on his own  he asks  Again  unlike anyone else in the world into which he s dropped when he returns home from Europe  Mark wants to know  wants to understand  And so he peppers Jessie with questions  evincing a curiosity so sincere it makes her uncomfortable  It s so foreign to her experience that she instinctively pushes back  assuming something inappropriate is being done  And  in a way  Jessie is right   in her world  curiosity is forbidden  because it undermines the polite looking away  and the vast network of lies that define her class and her life   By the time their relationship ends  Jessie wishes there was time   always  the need for more time   for Mark to ask more questions  to evince her truth It s hard to know what  exactly  to take from all this  It feels facile to say that the truth tellers shine lights on flaws that otherwise are ignored  because it s more complicated than that  Were the flaws between Jessie and Brandon there before Isabel arrived with her destructive  alluring truths  Was she illuminating the cracks  or creating them  Or was she doing a bit of both  Would Jessie have left Brandon without Mark s quiet  generous speaking and seeking of truth  Can we really know what impact his voice and actions had on her life and her choices Ultimately  perhaps  seeking an answer here is unsatisfying  but the lingering questions serve to highlight the film s steadfast refusal to engage in oversimplification  either of individuals or relationships ,4.5,sakana1

99627,"East Side, West Side",1949, Very enjoyable melodrama that knows just what to do with the varied talents of Stanwyck  Gardner  Mason and Heflin You can tell it comes from a book and one that presumably made a lot more of the social ups and downs of Stanwyck s characters life  the film periodically brings in references to her in relationship to the various sections of manhattan that give the film it s name but they don t really stick in the transition to 110 minute movie  Either that or 1949 wasn t the time for full on class consciousness even from writers who were fully paid cup card carrying communists  But what it loses in detailed characterisation and what felt like a very compressed story it gained in it s use of actors  Stanwyck and Mason don t have much chemistry together  they never quite make the marriage at the centre of the story seem like something worth fighting over and the story also doesn t quite make it explicitly something to escape  so you don t get full on possessive Mason  Instead you get vain and weak little boy Mason but he s great at that too and it s a charming odious performance wonderfully summed up by Stanwyck s mother in a final scene  stanwyck is of course great  with Cyd Charisse  another character who came across as being more important in the source material not that i know that for sure  but especially with Van Heflin  Their scenes together resonate with that elusive grown up sexuality and spark that Stanwyck did so well through the late 40s and 50s and he really impressed in his scenes opposite her  you do for all the corniness of the classic 40s womans picture really invest in them even 60 plus years on It s not a very top drawer Stanwyck picture or performance but everyone involved clearly knows what it has in her and how to support it and thats a guaranteed great way to spend a few hours ,4.0,Owen
99627,"East Side, West Side",1949, Ava Gardner is simply sensational in this film  From her first appearance  when she poses an immediate and present danger to the wobbly marriage of Barbara Stanwyck and James Mason  you can t help but think  Move over  Barbara honey  you ain t got a chance  Ava s opening scene ranks with Rita Hayworth s entrance in Gilda for pure wow factor  She looks utterly ravishing  and thereafter she delivers her stream of marvellous vampy lines with the brio of a pedigree bitch Her three co stars  Van Heflin completing the quartet  don t slouch either  This is an intelligent adult drama about infidelity with notably good dialogue and an unusually modern grasp on sexual mores   kudos to Isobel Lennart for the script  Mervyn LeRoy keeps things simmering nicely and elicits performances that resemble real people  The East Side West Side element is underplayed since none of the actors have an East Side feel to them   classy Cyd Charisse is meant to be from the wrong side of the Park  for heaven s sake When the glossy drama veers into crime story at one point  who should be the detective but future Frank Cannon  William Conrad  Future First Lady Nancy Davis plays a snooty socialite  Future blacklistee  the fabulous Gale Sondergaard plays the mother of Barbara  in reality only eight years her junior  A genuine tragedy that this was the last film the studios permitted her to make before the onset of the witch hunting madness ,4.5,Fint
99627,"East Side, West Side",1949, East Side  West Side is one of the better mid century melodramas I ve seen  All four of the main characters  played by Barbara Stanwyck  James Mason  Ava Gardner  and Van Heflin  fill believable spaces and their actions all make sense for who they are  Something I can t say about all of these melodramas  These are people trying to live their life  and hollow out their own space  They just can t figure out the overlap  Everything Ava Gardner does is seductive and venomous  Just watching her lets you understand James Mason entirely  While Heflin  Gardner  and Mason are great  Stanwyck rises above the film  It s unfair for every other actor how much emotion Stanwyck can convey  She can do more just holding a straight face than what should be possible  Plus Cyd Charisse shows up in an early role ,3.5,AJ

68724,Elysium,2013, I m a dick  I ve suspected as much over the past few months  and tonight I officially recognized this fact about myself  In the five minutes after this movie was over  I was able to piss someone I saw this with off so much that they just stopped talking to me all together  This is entirely because I called them on their negative comments about the film  I m specifically using the wording  negative comments  as I feel criticisms denotes something valid  where as negative comments is more descriptive of someone s personal skewed view on something  Now an example of a criticism of Elysium would be calling out Jodie Foster s performance for being too hamy and put on  not to mention some horrible dubbing that she obviously had to do in post  That is a criticism of the film  A negative comment about the film would be stating that the film is ridiculous because the character should have done x  y  and z in order to have resolved the conflict  I m sorry  but I can t stand when someone is just spouting hate at a film based simply on the fact that said someone just thinks they are smarter than the movies they watch  I know this kind of makes me sound dickish  but hey  I fully admitted that I am in fact a dick As for Elysium as a film  I think it is entirely successful  The story is tight and the film never dwells to long on anything  which makes the film fly by  The movie chooses to deal in drastic contrasts and cliches rather than spending time developing that which doesn t need to be developed  and I truly appreciate this  The rich and poor are in a conflict  and that s all you need to know  That s also pure genre  using an established framework  in this case the 99  versus the 1  as a means to craft a story full of action and adventure  This is genre filmmaking at its finest  and I love it ,5.0,FilmApe
68724,Elysium,2013, Elysium  a place in Space where your tanning bed can cure all sickness and disease  but of course it s only for the rich  until Boston Bad Boy Matt Damon tries to change the rules  in Neill Blomkamp s sophomore effort that s nowhere near District 9  but it does highlight Blomkamp s talent as a gifted filmmaker  It s hard to love Elysium  but it sure looks pretty  Very nice visuals  The robots look cool as fuck  The gunplay kicks ass  Matt Damon looks like he s on roids  It s like Will Hunting started lifting weights  and wasn t a math genius  Jodie Foster  gets the award for most annoying politician in a movie directed by Neill Blomkamp  Pick your least favorite political figure  and I promise you will like him or her better than Ms  Foster  She is miscast  and by far the worst character in the movie  Another unsatisfying surprise was how awful William Fichtner is as Mr  Corporate Greedy Motherfucker  He s the clich d character from hell  However  there must be something in the water that makes Sharlto Copley act like a badass motherfucker in Blomkamp s films  He owns Elysium as Kruger  the mercenary motherfucker trying to kill Matt Damon  Mr  Copley and his henchmen kicked ass and they re the main reason l kinda enjoyed the film  Also  it was cool as fuck to see Diego Luna and his odd hairstyle  He plays Damon s sidekick pretty damn good  The biggest surprise was Wagner Moura from Elite Squad in an English speaking role  I m hoping like a motherfucker that Sharlto and Wagner make it into the new Alien movie  Alice Braga  brought back memories from City of God  but she was wasted  and her character had zero development  Blomkamp  tries to go all sociopolitical  but I wish he just stuck to the badass action  I get where he s coming from  and I respect him  but more shooting and less political mumbo jumbo would ve made Elysium a more enjoyable movie  It took multiple views for me to fall in love with District 9  I doubt a second view of Elysium will change my opinion  Watchable but forgettable ,3.0,Todd Gaines

68724,Elysium,2013, This is the most disappointed I ve been with a movie in a long time  Elysium is a mess  plain and simple  It had so many great ideas and talent at its core  and it squanders it all  It features an extremely lazy screenplay  poorly developed characters  terrible performances  and boring plot  It s a film that wanders on the border of decency  and quickly falls into despair When I first read the general concept of Elysium  I hoped it would be like director Neil Blomkamp s other feature  District 9  I hoped it would be a unique sci fi film  with a substantial amount of political and social commentary  The film sets up a good way to explain this commentary  but runs it into the ground soon after the film starts  Gone are the allusions to corporate greed  and richly corruption  Instead  we are given a cliche action movie plot with uninteresting characters and bad pacing  The plot is not unique  and its actually quite stupid  even by action movie standards  The characters meander  dealing with cybernetic brain implants  and exoskeletons  and it does nothing to make us care  There s no emotional attachment to these characters whatsoever  and any subtext is abandoned  The film does try to establish the character of Max  Matt Damon  but does it so poorly in a series of flashbacks that don t work  and add nothing to the story  In short  it s a complete mess The film suffers from several main problems  beginning with bad pacing  The film shifts interesting moments  with others that are downright stupid  such as  Jodie Foster s character trying to propose a coup  And even the  exciting  moments have no stakes or tension  and are poorly filmed with useless shaky cam  The second of these problems is the screenplay  Much of the dialogue is laughably bad  and nearly borders on self parody at points  Neil Blomkamp needs to put down the pen  and pick up a camera and put that camera on a tripod  The performances are no better  and the last main problem with the film  Matt Damon plays Matt Damon  and his childhood girlfriend  Alice Braga  is as forgettable as can be  Sharlto Copely is awful  and way over the top as the Elysium sleeper agent  Kruger  Jodie Foster is a little better than Mr  Copely  but is still laughably bad  But  definitely the worst case of over acting comes from mister Wagner Moura  who plays Spider  a character who is never truly explained  He s downright atrocious  and his line delivery is painful  It is odd  however  this film had a good cast and nearly every performance is bad  Again  squandered potential  The only redeemable aspects of Elysium are technical  The visual effects are fantastic  and the sound design is terrific  The score isn t too memorable  but it works in the moment  However  It feels like the budget was entirely spent on the effects  and no effort was put into anything else  Elysium sure is pretty  but there s no substance beneath  If the film was actually well written  and acted  it could ve easily been great I went into this film expecting a decent actioner  with maybe a little commentary  Probably a 3 5 film  Walking out  I felt I had just been given a stupid  poorly written mess of a film  Before I left  some of my friends debated going to see it the next day  After the end  I didn t hesitate to tell them  Elysium is bad  Save your money ,2.0,Daniel Kibbe

68724,Elysium,2013, reading all the reviews on here for this from 10 years ago is a real barometer for how much people took original sci fi films for granted during the early 2010s   elysium  edge of tomorrow  oblivion  audiences in that era were awash in genre riches compared to today  where it is increasingly impossible for these movies to exist on a big budget scale   just look at how badly the creator bombed  in the span of ten years we ve gone from these being a mainstay part of the hollywood ecosystem to science fiction being a vanishing outlier which isn t to say that elysium itself is perfect simply because it looks and acts like nothing that gets put in multiplexes today   although it IS that  i ve never been interested in blomkamp as a director but god damn it he really tries to make something singular here   what blockbuster nowadays begins with a premise of open class warfare and devotes a large part of its runtime to how its protagonist is a working stiff being screwed over by his hazardous job  remember when non indie movies were allowed to center around quasi normal people  i hope i m not coming across as hysterical here   watching this for the first time today made me so aware of how impoverished things have become in the american cinema  how it feels like we have to beg for every scrap of originality even within fantastical entertainment  yes  this movie s premise is broad and semi idiotic  seemingly none of the space wealthy actually live in their own homes  but it s not made without craft   blomkamp takes a james cameron esque eye for grimy detail and really does know how to frame his effects shots for maximum impact  the film looks and sounds fantastic  with a muscular combination of gritty production design and well staged digital landscapes  the exoskeleton stuff is awesome  and between this and edge of tomorrow you really see the almost fully realized version of heinlein s starship troopers powered armor  blomkamp frequently centers the camera right behind matt damon s back like you see in the poster and bobbles it with his steps in such a bizarre fashion  i m not sure how to describe it  but it effectively puts you within the heightened space of his cybernetic body and how it makes him move in a non human way on some level i m naturally predisposed to enjoy this sort of unpretentious trash   district 9 always struck me as too wrapped up in its own conspicuous metaphor which of course appealed to 2009 oscar voters and their blood diamond evocated white guilt  whereas elysium is just straight up a dorky sci fi amalgam that s under two hours and satisfies on its premise and has the god given decency to be rated R  i don t understand the hate that it received and would encourage people to check it out again  i think it s much better than its reputation suggests   neill blomkamp s garbage strewn world never falters  even as he builds it around cardboard characters and tenuous accents ,4.0,comrade_yui
68724,Elysium,2013, Overall  I enjoyed it for the most part  the movie got really cool at some parts but in the last half of the film it drags a few times  The film as a whole is a really cool idea and I personally got heavy Call of Duty Advanced Warfare vibes from it  While I find Jodie Foster to be an absolutely phenomenal actress normally  in this movie she really didn t fit  In fact all the villains were really forgettable in the film  I did enjoy Matt Damon for the most part  a lot of the action sequences were really fun to watch and it got pretty gory at times  I would recommend this to any fan of the Sci Fi Action Thriller genre but I wouldn t go in expecting a masterpiece by any means  It s definitely worth it to check the movie out if it s free on a streaming platform 6 10,3.0,üé• Kemper
68724,Elysium,2013, It is allegorical how in Elysium   director Neil Blomkamp designed an outer space habitat that people from earth can t reach  just as he created an ambitious  sci fi that he wasn t able to fine tune Elysium had the goods   the dependable acting strengths of Jodie Foster and Matt Damon  impressive set designs  supple fight scenes and non grainy special effects   but the storytelling didn t hold itself correctly like a set of metals haphazardly hammered together to form an ugly ass robot  Both the dystopian Earth and the luxurious Elysium wasn t probed further too  Elysium is quite a waste especially since the plot offers strong political commentary on societal class  immigration  overpopulation  and healthcare system ,3.0,King #adoptdontshop
68724,Elysium,2013, Well that was all kinds of not good  huh I wasn t a huge fan of DISTRICT 9  but at least that film found a central sci fi metaphor that worked  ELYSIUM starts from a promising idea   this future of haves and have nots  with the wealthy above on this satellite of love and magical healing machines  and the poor left to rot below   but Blomkamp clearly put the cart before the metaphorse  The whole plot is jury rigged with deus ex machinas and enormous holes and one dimensional characters just to keep things moving and to give him the pieces he needs to make his points I have no idea  but if I had to guess  I suspect there s a smarter version of this movie lying around in an editing bay somewhere  The cut I just watched is 109 minutes and feels trimmed to the bone  After some fairly leisurely introductory scenes  the best in the film  it s pretty much all chases and gunfights and more chases  Matt Damon s character  Max  is dying of radiation poisoning  and has only five days to live  The robo doctor gives him a vial of medicine that s supposed to keep him going until he croaks  and for the first few scenes after his accident  Damon s stumbling and sickly  But then he gets his dopey exo suit  and after that he never takes his medication again  and never acts sick again until the very end of the film  Okay  so maybe the exo suit protects him from the radiation poisoning   but if that s the case  then there s no need for him to go through all this hassle to get to Elysium  If all you re interested in is cool sci fi gizmos  the movie has its fair share  Blomkamp is nothing if not a techno fetishist  But he seems a lot more interested in how things look than how things work   the exo suit  for example  is an enigma  It makes Max stronger  Does it also make him an awesome fighter  too  Max is like your run of the mill thief and factory worker  but suddenly he s going toe to toe with super soldiers like it s no big whoop  Similarly  Elysium is a beautiful image and rather perfect  probably  too  perfect  symbol for the unfeeling 1  but there s absolutely no attention given to how the place works or how its citizens live  How does the place have an atmosphere in space  Why can ships land on it directly  without passing through some kind of force field or air shield  Why doesn t anyone care that evil Secretary Jodie Foster is slaughtering innocent people in cold blood  And maybe this is part of Blomkamp s point about wealth and privilege  but how come no one is EVER home every single time a refuge breaks into a house on Elysium to use its med bay  The place is practically a ghost town Likewise  the magic med bay machines that are the movie s big MacGuffin don t make any sense either  At some points they can bring people back to life  one character gets their entire head blown off and is healed  prompting the hilarious line  His brain s fine   we can bring him back  at other points they can t fix comparatively minor injuries  Basically they can do whatever the script demands they can or can t do at any given point  The whole story builds to a climax that is supposed to be happy but is hopelessly naive   Uh  wasn t overpopulation a pretty serious problem on Earth  this solves that HOW exactly Also  what the hell happened to Sharlto Copley  Between this and OLDBOY  he s had a terrible 2013  Someone put him in an ELYSIUM med bay and see if it can repair his acute case of overactorcitis ,1.5,Matt Singer
68724,Elysium,2013, Predictability rules the roost in Elysium as it dissolves any trace of originality and delivers a tasteless  mundane affair that succeeds only as an exposition of the big budget production  Five minutes into the film I knew how it was going to end or had a good idea of it  Seeing my predictions come true one after another was sorely disappointing  as I had huge hopes pinned on Blomkamp and his sophomore  heavily anticipated project ever since it was announced  especially  after being floored by the trailer  I was betting heavily on this to become the next big thing in the sci fi genre because unlike District 9 Blomkamp had big studio backing  all the resources and a world class cast  District 9 at its core had the basic tried and tested idea of Aliens vs Humans but its presentation  the metaphorical homeland themes of apartheid that were intricately carved into the story and above all the physical and mental transformation of Wikus van de Merwe provided for a stunningly refreshing experience and made it ascend contemporary greatness  But unlike District 9  Elysium comfortably submits itself to any and all possible stereotypes than can ever be imagined in such a grandiose scenario  I was actually surprised at the complete fulfilment of all my prognostications because I believed in Blomkamp and because he never brought any of his famed magic to the show Where do I begin with regards to the clich s  as you can guess from the opening words there are plenty of them  and each as potent as the other in revealing and reminding the viewer that this is nothing different from what we have already seen and experienced  Barely a few minutes into the film  we are shown the younger version of Max  Damon  and Frey  Alice Braga  That the director chose to begin with showing us their childhood versions can itself termed as a clich  but it would be too harsh  so I abstain from calling it that  We see Max promise Frey that one day he will take her to Elysium  Bang  That is it  Damn  this movie had almost incepted into my brain the whole of its brain data into mine before I could even start witnessing it  The punch line for clich s is Oh  Here we go and I found myself saying that so many times over the duration of Elysium  And do not get me started on the logical plot holes  Like Earth in 2159  Elysium s script is severely overpopulated by dreadfully evident and easily objectionable plot holes  And also the dialogues were absolute abomination to put things shortly as to not prolong painful stabbing Although I am not done with all of them  I think I have got my point across about its tired scenarios  so with considerable reluctance I am moving on  Jodie Foster is totally horrendous  She almost attains the peak effect of  I cannot believe my ears  level of badness here  Her accent is all over the place  All over the place can be literally implied as between here and Elysium  Good God  what was she thinking speaking that way  There were several instances of her pronouncing the same word in inexplicably different ways within a very short span  A striking example is the word habitat reached my ears as Hob bit at and Hae bi tat  That her character is a dreadful avalanche of clich s adds salt to the seething wound  She is the typical bitchy  high class  misanthrope who has to be killed before the film ends  That she is going to be put down was always apparent but by whom is the real surprise which definitely warrants a watch  Where she gets hurt before breathing her last is also poetic justice delivered Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley when considering the other terrible shortcomings can be termed the only two redeeming factors in Elysium  Both have given their heart and soul and it shows in their performances  Copley s insanity and over the topness confluence with his utterly ravishing  alluring Afrikaner accent to provide a decent amount of fun in the otherwise terribly put together mess  His voice and manner of speech felt like honey dripping into my ears after the Foster Massacre  Whenever he was on screen it was an overflow of charisma  Damon too brings in his top game as he effectively manages to engage the audience with the plight his character goes through even though it is nothing new and every seasoned film lover will know there are only two ways it would end  His character is so plain and painfully simple and there is nothing much that can be done with it with such a famine of creativity all around  Damon s Max is the quintessential hero who is destined for great things and Copley s Kruger is the perennial bad guy  Any difference I noticed was purely because of the actors and their improvisations but regrettably  I cannot attribute anything significant to the writing A hose pipe of scalding water was pointed to the already hurting wound when the Shaky  the fuckhead  Cam came on  We talk about Lynch and Nolan messing with our brains and stuff like that  but when it comes to physically hurting my head or the ingredients of it  there is no competition to the paranormal success that Mr  Shaky Cam has achieved  I cannot ever decipher the reason for using shaky cam and even if there were a proper justification I refuse to accept it  For me  it is the worst possible way to picturize a film  induces a severe head ache  sometimes nausea too and a one Mr  Deakins would not be very pleased if he saw your film The shots of Elysium look stunning  the gadgets are amazing  Copley is remarkable  Damon s head and his droid gear are magnificent  the spaceships and also some of the robots  several looked they were straight out of an anime  were decently designed  The positives of the film are so heavily mired behind its muddy pitfalls  It is similar to searching for a few pearls in an endless pile of trash  Do not get me wrong here  I am not saying this is trashy  it is definitely a sincere attempt from Blomkamp  just that the whole feature felt so exhausted considering the plethora of reincarnated clich s that are strewn all over ,2.5,Peaceful Stoner

68724,Elysium,2013, I m a dick  I ve suspected as much over the past few months  and tonight I officially recognized this fact about myself  In the five minutes after this movie was over  I was able to piss someone I saw this with off so much that they just stopped talking to me all together  This is entirely because I called them on their negative comments about the film  I m specifically using the wording  negative comments  as I feel criticisms denotes something valid  where as negative comments is more descriptive of someone s personal skewed view on something  Now an example of a criticism of Elysium would be calling out Jodie Foster s performance for being too hamy and put on  not to mention some horrible dubbing that she obviously had to do in post  That is a criticism of the film  A negative comment about the film would be stating that the film is ridiculous because the character should have done x  y  and z in order to have resolved the conflict  I m sorry  but I can t stand when someone is just spouting hate at a film based simply on the fact that said someone just thinks they are smarter than the movies they watch  I know this kind of makes me sound dickish  but hey  I fully admitted that I am in fact a dick As for Elysium as a film  I think it is entirely successful  The story is tight and the film never dwells to long on anything  which makes the film fly by  The movie chooses to deal in drastic contrasts and cliches rather than spending time developing that which doesn t need to be developed  and I truly appreciate this  The rich and poor are in a conflict  and that s all you need to know  That s also pure genre  using an established framework  in this case the 99  versus the 1  as a means to craft a story full of action and adventure  This is genre filmmaking at its finest  and I love it ,5.0,FilmApe
68724,Elysium,2013, Elysium  a place in Space where your tanning bed can cure all sickness and disease  but of course it s only for the rich  until Boston Bad Boy Matt Damon tries to change the rules  in Neill Blomkamp s sophomore effort that s nowhere near District 9  but it does highlight Blomkamp s talent as a gifted filmmaker  It s hard to love Elysium  but it sure looks pretty  Very nice visuals  The robots look cool as fuck  The gunplay kicks ass  Matt Damon looks like he s on roids  It s like Will Hunting started lifting weights  and wasn t a math genius  Jodie Foster  gets the award for most annoying politician in a movie directed by Neill Blomkamp  Pick your least favorite political figure  and I promise you will like him or her better than Ms  Foster  She is miscast  and by far the worst character in the movie  Another unsatisfying surprise was how awful William Fichtner is as Mr  Corporate Greedy Motherfucker  He s the clich d character from hell  However  there must be something in the water that makes Sharlto Copley act like a badass motherfucker in Blomkamp s films  He owns Elysium as Kruger  the mercenary motherfucker trying to kill Matt Damon  Mr  Copley and his henchmen kicked ass and they re the main reason l kinda enjoyed the film  Also  it was cool as fuck to see Diego Luna and his odd hairstyle  He plays Damon s sidekick pretty damn good  The biggest surprise was Wagner Moura from Elite Squad in an English speaking role  I m hoping like a motherfucker that Sharlto and Wagner make it into the new Alien movie  Alice Braga  brought back memories from City of God  but she was wasted  and her character had zero development  Blomkamp  tries to go all sociopolitical  but I wish he just stuck to the badass action  I get where he s coming from  and I respect him  but more shooting and less political mumbo jumbo would ve made Elysium a more enjoyable movie  It took multiple views for me to fall in love with District 9  I doubt a second view of Elysium will change my opinion  Watchable but forgettable ,3.0,Todd Gaines

its presentation  the metaphorical homeland themes of apartheid that were intricately carved into the story and above all the physical and mental transformation of Wikus van de Merwe provided for a stunningly refreshing experience and made it ascend contemporary greatness  But unlike District 9  Elysium comfortably submits itself to any and all possible stereotypes than can ever be imagined in such a grandiose scenario  I was actually surprised at the complete fulfilment of all my prognostications because I believed in Blomkamp and because he never brought any of his famed magic to the show Where do I begin with regards to the clich s  as you can guess from the opening words there are plenty of them  and each as potent as the other in revealing and reminding the viewer that this is nothing different from what we have already seen and experienced  Barely a few minutes into the film  we are shown the younger version of Max  Damon  and Frey  Alice Braga  That the director chose to begin with showing us their childhood versions can itself termed as a clich  but it would be too harsh  so I abstain from calling it that  We see Max promise Frey that one day he will take her to Elysium  Bang  That is it  Damn  this movie had almost incepted into my brain the whole of its brain data into mine before I could even start witnessing it  The punch line for clich s is Oh  Here we go and I found myself saying that so many times over the duration of Elysium  And do not get me started on the logical plot holes  Like Earth in 2159  Elysium s script is severely overpopulated by dreadfully evident and easily objectionable plot holes  And also the dialogues were absolute abomination to put things shortly as to not prolong painful stabbing Although I am not done with all of them  I think I have got my point across about its tired scenarios  so with considerable reluctance I am moving on  Jodie Foster is totally horrendous  She almost attains the peak effect of  I cannot believe my ears  level of badness here  Her accent is all over the place  All over the place can be literally implied as between here and Elysium  Good God  what was she thinking speaking that way  There were several instances of her pronouncing the same word in inexplicably different ways within a very short span  A striking example is the word habitat reached my ears as Hob bit at and Hae bi tat  That her character is a dreadful avalanche of clich s adds salt to the seething wound  She is the typical bitchy  high class  misanthrope who has to be killed before the film ends  That she is going to be put down was always apparent but by whom is the real surprise which definitely warrants a watch  Where she gets hurt before breathing her last is also poetic justice delivered Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley when considering the other terrible shortcomings can be termed the only two redeeming factors in Elysium  Both have given their heart and soul and it shows in their performances  Copley s insanity and over the topness confluence with his utterly ravishing  alluring Afrikaner accent to provide a decent amount of fun in the otherwise terribly put together mess  His voice and manner of speech felt like honey dripping into my ears after the Foster Massacre  Whenever he was on screen it was an overflow of charisma  Damon too brings in his top game as he effectively manages to engage the audience with the plight his character goes through even though it is nothing new and every seasoned film lover will know there are only two ways it would end  His character is so plain and painfully simple and there is nothing much that can be done with it with such a famine of creativity all around  Damon s Max is the quintessential hero who is destined for great things and Copley s Kruger is the perennial bad guy  Any difference I noticed was purely because of the actors and their improvisations but regrettably  I cannot attribute anything significant to the writing A hose pipe of scalding water was pointed to the already hurting wound when the Shaky  the fuckhead  Cam came on  We talk about Lynch and Nolan messing with our brains and stuff like that  but when it comes to physically hurting my head or the ingredients of it  there is no competition to the paranormal success that Mr  Shaky Cam has achieved  I cannot ever decipher the reason for using shaky cam and even if there were a proper justification I refuse to accept it  For me  it is the worst possible way to picturize a film  induces a severe head ache  sometimes nausea too and a one Mr  Deakins would not be very pleased if he saw your film The shots of Elysium look stunning  the gadgets are amazing  Copley is remarkable  Damon s head and his droid gear are magnificent  the spaceships and also some of the robots  several looked they were straight out of an anime  were decently designed  The positives of the film are so heavily mired behind its muddy pitfalls  It is similar to searching for a few pearls in an endless pile of trash  Do not get me wrong here  I am not saying this is trashy  it is definitely a sincere attempt from Blomkamp  just that the whole feature felt so exhausted considering the plethora of reincarnated clich s that are strewn all over ,2.5,Peaceful Stoner

10498,Point of No Return,1993, Point of No Return is the type of film for me that works almost entirely down to a strong lead performance  since the rest of the film is rather rote and predictable  I can t judge this as a remake of Luc Besson s La Femme Nikita because I ve never seen the original but solely as an action film and story  this movie is hardly remarkable and the plot mostly stays standard throughout  marked only by a few solid action sequences that occasionally jolt some energy into the picture  The tone of the film is probably the bigger issue since it often feels caught between a more serious dramatic thriller and a substantially cheesier and lighthearted action film  with the two vastly different tones ensuring that the movie doesn t feel very coherent  Where it does shine though  is that it has a very good lead performance from Bridget Fonda who makes for a pretty convincing action hero and really does her part in making the film work  Some of the supporting players also do good work  Gabriel Byrne and Harvey Keitel in particular  but the cast is really the only consistently good part of Point of No Return since the rest is mostly forgettable and mediocre ,3.0,AndrewC

65291,Green Lantern: Emerald Knights,2011, 53 100 When you shape the light of your ring  you walk in the footsteps of the first Lantern The second DC anthology film in their original animated canon  Lauren Montgomery  amp  Jay Olivia s Green Lantern  Emerald Knights is another great entry into the world and I appreciate them doing Green Lantern because we ve only gotten three films of the character s  and it s got the biggest mythology out of all the characters so it deserves more praise  While it may not be a sequel to Green Lantern  First Flight  the style is similar and it was easily one of its finest moments When it comes to the voice cast  Green Lantern  Emerald Knights is easily one of the greatest in the animated canon  Nathan Fillion is absolutely fantastic as Hal Jordon  I seriously can t see anyone else in that voice he fit the character so perfectly  Jason Issacs was a great addition as Sinestro  and Elisabeth Moss  Arisia was also good  While I wish it was more of a one plot line flick  Green Lantern  Emerald Knights is a great entry into the DC animated canon 2011 RankedPart of Superhero Films RankedNext in DC Animation Marathon,3.0,Ian
65291,Green Lantern: Emerald Knights,2011, This was DC s second attempt at doing an Anthology  like animation film with multiple storylines and like Batman  Gotham Knight before it  I m not that big of a fan of this movie either  Here were subjected to a series of short stories about B List Green Lanterns and their histories  The main plot around these stories sees Hal and Lanterns preparing to fight the villain Krona  Krona is a really cool villain in the comics but disappointingly isn t in this film a lot  It s hard to connect with any of these characters because the stories are so short and the plot in each feels thin  The only one that really stood out as sort of interesting was the story of the first Green Lantern and a side adventure between Sinestro and Abin Sur  That s what this movie feels like ultimately  One big side adventure as by the time we get to Lanterns fighting Krona I was pretty uninterested thanks to poor stories I was just subjected to  On the positive side  the animation is a lot like the other Green Lantern animated flick First Flight which is strong  And I like the voice cast  especially Natan Fillion as Hal Jordan  Unfortunately there s not enough meat on this bone to make it stand out from the other DC entries  It s also a clear step down from the aforementioned First Flight as well   Batman  Year One Review  boxd it 4w4LVL,2.0,Marqus Rice

566810,The Dark Kingdom,2018, I was talking with a colleague about bad designers today  and he recalled a story of a designer in education who was lauded as being  a good designer  but a shame you have no heart Which I think sums up this experience in a way  Some of the effects are wonderful  There s a lot of quality costume builds  and a handful of really effective  effects But the whole of it feels like it s been very mechanically made  and without a sort of passion As mentioned by others  there s also no end  It really does just cut halfway through the story  like a TV episode 4 stars for everything1 star for the good effects ,2.0,Phill

4822,Kismet,1955, There is such an excess of presentational fantasy in  Kismet  that the Vincente Minnelli film is almost in want of what no other musical comedy need ever be in want of  humility The fifth movie version of a 1911 play   Kismet  is the tale of a beggar poet turned magic swindler  who tangles himself and his many schemes inside the court of a tyrannical ruler of Baghdad Kismet  is somewhat of an outlier in golden age musicals  with a score that draws adaption from classical music  and turns it into showtunes  Most all of the songs originate from compositions by the romantic Georgian composer Alexander Borodin  The concept is an interesting one  but not necessarily best employed in the conveyance of a story set in a mystical version of the Middle East In this gap of cultural falsehood between  Kismet  and its invented setting  so too is there a loss of emotional fidelity  A fantastical setting and deliberately concocted interpretation could be employed successfully  especially in a musical comedy  see   Brigadoon  However   Kismet  does not have the honest sentimentality of its Scottish set sister work  Nor  really  any investment of emotional sentiment at all The main cast of  Kismet  is as phony in their performance as they are in their passing as Arabic in descent  While blessed with lead Howard Keel s deep baritone that rumbles through some luscious solos  there is little to like about a group of actors who put on character facades so flimsy  it wouldn t even take a desert sandstorm to knock them over There is a certain staginess that is acceptable and even welcome in the tradition of musical comedies  And then  there is a step beyond that  which is where  Kismet  dwells  In the business of making believe that song arises out of a swelling of feeling  there is a necessity of genuine passion  When Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse serenade each other in the make believe Brigadoon  it becomes real   Kismet s  Baghdad  though  remains as false as the replica baubles adoring its actors  no more genuine in their performance than fool s gold Golden Age Musicals,1.5,theriverjordan
4822,Kismet,1955, Vincente Minnelli s worst musical Would have played better as a George Sidney Jupiter s Darling kind of crazy pastiche  or with Minnelli directing leads with more nuance and depth   But Howard Keel doesn t have Gene Kelly s dark side and Minnelli s too coherent an artist for anything goes anarchism  As it is  there s a germ of an interesting idea  Keel s accidental magical powers and the way humans process coincidence in their lives as fate  luck  the will of God The Orientalist costumes and set design are ridiculous and amazing  so many wonderful hats  I imagine that s where most of Minnelli s focus was anyway  I suppose we re too good for such things nowadays  but I admit to loving the way Golden Age Hollywood toured the world without ever leaving its studios  They had no interest in showing the world as it actually was  but rather subsumed it all into their own fantasy creations  A vision that united the world in the spirit of play and adventure and romance  Condescending and imperialist to be sure  but a utopian vision nonetheless ,3.0,Sean Gilman
4822,Kismet,1955, For as much as the general consensus is that this is not great  I kind of enjoyed it  Like  it definitely has similar vibes going with Yolanda and the Thief and The Pirate  including some unfortunate brownface  But it looks amazing  and my descent into the films of Jon Hall and Maria Montez have acclimated me to movies taking place in a very California caliphate  I would wear the hell out of any of Howard Keel s costumes in this  and as Lypsinka had taught us  Dolores Gray is always top tier  Still haven t recovered from the verse in Rahadlakum  that advises  or so I m interpreting it  the wives of faithless husbands to pleasure themselves until their husbands get interested in sex again  which actually isn t horrible advice ,3.5,Bill
4822,Kismet,1955, I saw your face  and I ascendedOut of the commonplace  into the rareSomewhere in space  I hang suspendedUntil I know there s a chance that you care  Stranger in ParadiseA surprisingly excellent  even magical later MGM musical with an Arabian Nights flavour  adapted by Charles Lederer and Luther Davis from their own hit Broadway play  about Baghdad based thief Howard Keel setting himself up as a kingmaking sorcerer  while his daughter  Ann Blyth  falls in love with the incognito caliph  Vic Damone Its world is rather gaudily realised and  since the admittedly cheesy Keel can t dance  his songs generally feature him striding or crawling around  but the story is engaging  the script is pretty funny and the exuberantly performed score is absolutely and unequivocally fantastic  with complex melodies coupled to either witty  intricately rhymed lyrics or a surfeit of genuine emotion  in numbers like Stranger in Paradise  And This Is My Beloved and the spectacular Not Since Nineveh  a knockout dance number featuring the flexible  Fosse ish  Princesses of Ababu   Reiko Sato  Patricia Dunn and Wonci Liu  The latter is vocalised by Dolores Gray who is  as usual  bloody amazing I ve had this for ages but had never gotten around to it  imagining  with no good reason  that it would be bloated and self serious  with little resonance beyond its immediate story  It s anything but  and  while it remains extremely divisive   particularly among fans of the play   I really loved it ,4.5,Rick Burin

4822,Kismet,1955, Look  I didn t do myself any favors by watching a CinemaScope musical on a 13  TV VCR  but I don t think there s much for me to like here in any case  There are bouts of crafty comedic dialogue  but the romantic plot is weak  and most of the songs  too  And for a Minnelli picture  it s uncharacteristically flat looking  There s no dazzle  no cinematic flair  The sets and costumes aren t thrilling enough for this to be such a front and center production  There s little to distinguish it from a stage show  Give me some editing  Let a scarf wipe the frame and reveal a new stage  Or at the very least  give me more than one dance number   Mike and Dave s Scavenger Hunt  Vol  18    And Then There Was X ebeche 37 60VHS Chronicles 127,2.5,Xebeche
4822,Kismet,1955, The orientalism makes me uneasy  but I can t see that it does any harm to speak of  especially when subjected to the queering influence of Minnelli and crew  Visual excess like I ve never seen from him them  I m tempted to caall it Minelli s peplum  or the nearest Team Minelli ever got to the outrageous overkill of the most unfettered Powell  amp  Pressburgers  if I don t unreservedly love it  it s because the music failed to connect with me   though that s clearly not my call to make ,3.5,Lencho of the Apes
4822,Kismet,1955, This film  a remake with music of the 1944 Kismet  looks sumptuous and boasts a fine cast  including Howard Keel  Ann Blyth  Vic Damone  and Doleres Gray  who didn t make enough films although the ones she did are great Using themes from Borodin  classic songs such as  This is My Beloved   Stranger in Paradise   Olive Tree  and others sound beautiful  and benefit from strong singers presenting them The story of  Kismet  is simple   a beggar named Hajj  or is he  has magical powers to foresee the future and influence events  or does he  and finds himself in the court of the Caliph  In the meantime the Caliph  weary of his harem  finds true love in the person of a mysterious young woman  name unknown  And the wife of the Wazir is just looking for a good time  Potent tosh  as most musicals were   Kismet  is not one of MGM s best   by 1955 the genre was beginning to slow down and lose steam  and properties like this did not have the money or time they deserved lavished on them  But the songs and performances help this film achieve a respectability and level of involvement others made at the time may not have  and so it gets a decent score from me ,4.0,loureviews
